  abstract = {Incompleteness of reference sequence databases and unresolved taxonomic relationships complicates taxonomic placement of fungal sequences. We developed Protax-fungi, a general tool for taxonomic placement of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and implemented it into the PlutoF platform of the UNITE database for molecular identification of fungi. With empirical data on root- and wood-associated fungi, Protax-fungi reliably identified (with at least 90\% identification probability) the majority of sequences to the order level but only around one-fifth of them to the species level, reflecting the current limited coverage of the databases. Protax-fungi outperformed the Sintax and Rdb classifiers in terms of increased accuracy and decreased calibration error when applied to data on mock communities representing species groups with poor sequence database coverage. We applied Protax-fungi to examine the internal consistencies of the Index Fungorum and UNITE databases. This revealed inconsistencies in the taxonomy database as well as mislabelling and sequence quality problems in the reference database. The according improvements were implemented in both databases. Protax-fungi provides a robust tool for performing statistically reliable identifications of fungi in spite of the incompleteness of extant reference sequence databases and unresolved taxonomic relationships.},

  abstract = {The international DNA sequence databases abound in fungal sequences not annotated beyond the kingdom level, typically bearing names such as ``uncultured fungus''. These sequences beget low-resolution mycological results and invite further deposition of similarly poorly annotated entries. What do these sequences represent? This study uses a 767,918-sequence corpus of public full-length fungal ITS sequences to estimate what proportion of the 95,055 ``uncultured fungus'' sequences that represent truly unidentifiable fungal taxa -- and what proportion of them that would have been straightforward to annotate to some more meaningful taxonomic level at the time of sequence deposition. Our results suggest that more than 70\% of these sequences would have been trivial to identify to at least the order/family level at the time of sequence deposition, hinting that factors other than poor availability of relevant reference sequences explain the low-resolution names. We speculate that researchers' perceived lack of time and lack of insight into the ramifications of this problem are the main explanations for the low-resolution names. We were surprised to find that more than a fifth of these sequences seem to have been deposited by mycologists rather than researchers unfamiliar with the consequences of poorly annotated fungal sequences in molecular repositories. The proportion of these needlessly poorly annotated sequences does not decline over time, suggesting that this problem must not be left unchecked.},

  abstract = {The population genetics and spatial structure of the fairy ring fungus Marasmius oreades (Bolt. : Fr.) Fr. was studied by DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF). Basidiocarp samples were collected from fairy rings from two separate sand dune systems of about 560 m2 and 1750 m2, respectively, on the Lista Peninsula in southwestern Norway in 1996. Samples were collected after a careful mapping of fairy rings and a vegetation survey of the composition and spatial structure of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. DAF with standard arbitrary oligonucleotide primers was used to examine the genetic relationship between basidiocarp samples. The study showed that the fungal population contained a high number of genotypes and that about 90\% of the fairy rings represented a separate genet. Both cluster and phylogenetic analyses of DAF amplification products established relationships between fairy rings and showed that genetically similar basidiocarps were found close to each other. Overall results showed a weak correspondence between genotype and spatial distribution and no correspondence between genotype and composition of the surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, the occurrence of the four dominant sand dune grass species was randomly distributed among the localities housing the various fungal genotypes, indicating that the fungus did not exhibit genotypic specialization to the various grass species that could host it as a pathogen. Results show that establishment of new individuals generally was mediated by basidiospore dispersal and not by fragmenting dikaryotic, vegetative mycelium, as previously proposed.},

Fungi are a megadiverse kingdom that plays a key role in ecosystem processes and affects human well-being. How urbanization influences fungi has remained poorly understood, partially due to the methodological difficulties in comprehensively surveying fungi. Here we show that both aerial and soil fungal communities are greatly poorer in urban than in natural areas. Strikingly, a fivefold reduction in fungal DNA abundance took place in both air and soil samples already at 1\,km scale when crossing the edge from natural to urban habitats. Furthermore, in the air, fungal diversity decreased with urbanization even more than in the soil. This result is counterintuitive as fungal spores are known to disperse over large distances. A large proportion of the fungi detectable in the air are specialized to natural habitats, whereas soil fungal communities comprise a large proportion of habitat generalists. The sensitivity of the aerial fungal community to anthropogenic disturbance makes this method a reliable and efficient bioindicator of ecosystem health in urban areas.},

  abstract = {Fungi are among the most diverse and ecologically important kingdoms in life. However, the distributional ranges of fungi remain largely unknown as do the ecological mechanisms that shape their distributions1,2. To provide an integrated view of the spatial and seasonal dynamics of fungi, we implemented a globally distributed standardized aerial sampling of fungal spores3. The vast majority of operational taxonomic units were detected within only one climatic zone, and the spatiotemporal patterns of species richness and community composition were mostly explained by annual mean air temperature. Tropical regions hosted the highest fungal diversity except for lichenized, ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi, which reached their peak diversity in temperate regions. The sensitivity in climatic responses was associated with phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting that large-scale distributions of some fungal groups are partially constrained by their ancestral niche. There was a strong phylogenetic signal in seasonal sensitivity, suggesting that some groups of fungi have retained their ancestral trait of sporulating for only a short period. Overall, our results show that the hyperdiverse kingdom of fungi follows globally highly predictable spatial and temporal dynamics, with seasonality in both species richness and community composition increasing with latitude. Our study reports patterns resembling those described for other major groups of organisms, thus making a major contribution to the long-standing debate on whether organisms with a microbial lifestyle follow the global biodiversity paradigms known for macroorganisms4,5.},

  abstract = {Background: When samples are collected in the field and transported to the lab, degradation of the nucleic acids contained in the samples is frequently observed. Immediate extraction and precipitation of the nucleic acids reduces degradation to a minimum, thus preserving accurate sequence information. An extraction method to obtain high quality DNA in field studies is described. Findings: DNA extracted immediately after sampling was compared to DNA extracted after allowing the sampled tissues to air dry at 21{$^\circ$}C for 48 or 72 hours. While DNA extracted from fresh tissues exhibited little degradation, DNA extracted from all tissues exposed to 21{$^\circ$}C air for 48 or 72 hours exhibited varying degrees of degradation. Yield was higher for extractions from fresh tissues in most cases. Four microcentrifuges were compared for DNA yield: one standard electric laboratory microcentrifuge (max rcf = 16,000{\texttimes}g), two battery-operated microcentrifuges (max rcf = 5,000 and 3,000 {\texttimes}g), and one manually-operated microcentrifuge (max rcf = 120{\texttimes}g). Yields for all centrifuges were similar. DNA extracted under simulated field conditions was similar in yield and quality to DNA extracted in the laboratory using the same equipment. Conclusions: This CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) DNA extraction method employs battery-operated and manually-operated equipment to isolate high quality DNA in the field. The method was tested on plant and fungus tissues, and may be adapted for other types of organisms. The method produced high quality DNA in laboratory tests and under simulated field conditions. The field extraction method should prove useful for working in remote sites, where ice, dry ice, and liquid nitrogen are unavailable; where degradation is likely to occur due to the long distances between the sample site and the laboratory; and in instances where other DNA preservation and transportation methods have been unsuccessful. It may be possible to adapt this method for genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic projects using samples collected in situ.},

Whereas the previous revision was successful in re-introducing name stability to the classification, this revision provides a classification for lineages that were then still unresolved. The supergroups have withstood phylogenetic hypothesis testing with some modifications, but despite some progress, problematic nodes at the base of the eukaryotic tree still remain to be statistically resolved. Looking forward, subsequent transformations to our understanding of the diversity of life will be from the discovery of novel lineages in previously under-sampled areas and from environmental genomic information.},

Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.},

  abstract = {Advances in genomics and sequencing technologies demand faster and more scalable analysis methods that can process longer sequences with higher accuracy. However, classical pairwise alignment methods, based on dynamic programming (DP), impose impractical computational requirements to align long and noisy sequences like those produced by PacBio, and Nanopore technologies. The recently proposed WFA algorithm paves the way for more efficient alignment tools, improving time and memory complexity over previous methods. However, high-performance computing (HPC) platforms require efficient parallel algorithms and tools to exploit the computing resources available on modern accelerator-based architectures.This paper presents WFA-GPU, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)-accelerated tool to compute exact gap-affine alignments based on the WFA algorithm. We present the algorithmic adaptations and performance optimizations that allow exploiting the massively parallel capabilities of modern GPU devices to accelerate the alignment computations. In particular, we propose a CPU-GPU co-design capable of performing inter-sequence and intra-sequence parallel sequence alignment, combining a succinct WFA-data representation with an efficient GPU implementation. As a result, we demonstrate that our implementation outperforms the original multi-threaded WFA implementation by up to 4.3 {\texttimes} and up to 18.2 {\texttimes} when using heuristic methods on long and noisy sequences. Compared to other state-of-the-art tools and libraries, the WFA-GPU is up to 29 {\texttimes} faster than other GPU implementations and up to four orders of magnitude faster than other CPU implementations. Furthermore, WFA-GPU is the only GPU solution capable of correctly aligning long reads using a commodity GPU.WFA-GPU code and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/quim0/WFA-GPU.},

  abstract = {Phylogenies involving nonmodel species are based on a few genes, mostly chosen following historical or practical criteria. Because gene trees are sometimes incongruent with species trees, the resulting phylogenies may not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships among species. The increase in availability of genome sequences now provides large numbers of genes that could be used for building phylogenies. However, for practical reasons only a few genes can be sequenced for a wide range of species. Here we asked whether we can identify a few genes, among the single-copy genes common to most fungal genomes, that are sufficient for recovering accurate and well-supported phylogenies. Fungi represent a model group for phylogenomics because many complete fungal genomes are available. An automated procedure was developed to extract single-copy orthologous genes from complete fungal genomes using a Markov Clustering Algorithm (Tribe-MCL). Using 21 complete, publicly available fungal genomes with reliable protein predictions, 246 single-copy orthologous gene clusters were identified. We inferred the maximum likelihood trees using the individual orthologous sequences and constructed a reference tree from concatenated protein alignments. The topologies of the individual gene trees were compared to that of the reference tree using three different methods. The performance of individual genes in recovering the reference tree was highly variable. Gene size and the number of variable sites were highly correlated and significantly affected the performance of the genes, but the average substitution rate did not. Two genes recovered exactly the same topology as the reference tree, and when concatenated provided high bootstrap values. The genes typically used for fungal phylogenies did not perform well, which suggests that current fungal phylogenies based on these genes may not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships among species. Analyses on subsets of species showed that the phylogenetic performance did not seem to depend strongly on the sample. We expect that the best-performing genes identified here will be very useful for phylogenetic studies of fungi, at least at a large taxonomic scale. Furthermore, we compare the method developed here for finding genes for building robust phylogenies with previous ones and we advocate that our method could be applied to other groups of organisms when more complete genomes are available.},

It resembles many north and south temperate species of Mallocybe but is most closely related to the southeast Asian tropical species, M. errata. M. africana is widely distributed in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast) extending to South-eastern Africa in Zambia. Phylogenetic analyses based on 5.8S rDNA, nLSU and RPB2 sequence data confirm that M. africana is nested within Mallocybe. A complete morphological description and illustrations, including photographs and line drawings, are presented.},

Additional analysis using ITS dataset shows interspecific variation between each species. Phylogenetic analyses resolve I. flavobrunneum in Old World Tropical clade 1 with weak support, I. bulbomarginatum is sister of Old World Tropical clade 1 and I. africanum is indicated as sister to the rest of Inosperma.

In the meantime the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICNafp) has changed from its former name (the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature) and introduced new formal requirements for valid publication of species scientific names, including the separation of provisions specific to Fungi and organisms treated as fungi in a new Chapter F. Equally transformative have been changes in the data collection, data dissemination, and analytical tools available to mycologists. This paper provides an updated and expanded discussion of current publication requirements along with best practices for the description of new fungal species and publication of new names and for improving accessibility of their associated metadata that have developed over the last 10\,years. Additionally, we provide: (1) model papers for different fungal groups and circumstances; (2) a checklist to simplify meeting (i) the requirements of the ICNafp to ensure the effective, valid and legitimate publication of names of new taxa, and (ii) minimally accepted standards for description; and, (3) templates for preparing standardized species descriptions.},

  abstract = {The explosion of bioinformatics technologies in the form of next generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated a massive influx of genomics data in the form of short reads. Short read mapping is therefore a fundamental component of next generation sequencing pipelines which routinely match these short reads against reference genomes for contig assembly. However, such techniques have seldom been applied to microbial marker gene sequencing studies, which have mostly relied on novel heuristic approaches. We propose NINJA Is Not Just Another OTU-Picking Solution (NINJA-OPS, or NINJA for short), a fast and highly accurate novel method enabling reference-based marker gene matching (picking Operational Taxonomic Units, or OTUs). NINJA takes advantage of the Burrows-Wheeler (BW) alignment using an artificial reference chromosome composed of concatenated reference sequences, the ``concatesome,'' as the BW input. Other features include automatic support for paired-end reads with arbitrary insert sizes. NINJA is also free and open source and implements several pre-filtering methods that elicit substantial speedup when coupled with existing tools. We applied NINJA to several published microbiome studies, obtaining accuracy similar to or better than previous reference-based OTU-picking methods while achieving an order of magnitude or more speedup and using a fraction of the memory footprint. NINJA is a complete pipeline that takes a FASTA-formatted input file and outputs a QIIME-formatted taxonomy-annotated BIOM file for an entire MiSeq run of human gut microbiome 16S genes in under 10 minutes on a dual-core laptop.},

We explore how decisions regarding study design, laboratory set-up, and bioinformatic processing affect the final results, and provide guidelines for reliable study of environmental samples. We evaluate the performance of four primer sets targeting COI and 16S regions characterizing arthropod diversity in bat faecal samples, and investigate how metabarcoding results are affected by parameters including: (1) number of PCR replicates per sample, (2) sequencing depth, (3) PCR replicate processing strategy (i.e. either additively, by combining the sequences obtained from the PCR replicates, or restrictively, by only retaining sequences that occur in multiple PCR replicates for each sample), (4) minimum copy number for sequences to be retained, (5) chimera removal, and (6) similarity thresholds for Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering. Lastly, we measure within- and between-taxa dissimilarities when using sequences from public databases to determine the most appropriate thresholds for OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment. Our results show that the use of multiple primer sets reduces taxonomic biases and increases taxonomic coverage. Taxonomic profiles resulting from each primer set are principally affected by how many PCR replicates are carried out per sample and how sequences are filtered across them, the sequence copy number threshold and the OTU clustering threshold. We also report considerable diversity differences between PCR replicates from each sample. Sequencing depth increases the dissimilarity between PCR replicates unless the bioinformatic strategies to remove allegedly artefactual sequences are adjusted according to the number of analysed sequences. Finally, we show that the appropriate identity thresholds for OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment differ between markers. Metabarcoding of complex environmental samples ideally requires (1) investigation of whether more than one primer sets targeting the same taxonomic group is needed to offset primer biases, (2) more than one PCR replicate per sample, (3) bioinformatic processing of sequences that balance diversity detection with removal of artefactual sequences, and (4) empirical selection of OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment thresholds tailored to each marker and the obtained taxa.},

  abstract = {Changes in soil nutrient availability during long-term ecosystem development influence the relative abundances of plant species with different nutrient-acquisition strategies. These changes in strategies are observed at the community level, but whether they also occur within individual species remains unknown. Plant species forming multiple root symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, and nitrogen-(N) fixing microorganisms provide valuable model systems to examine edaphic controls on symbioses related to nutrient acquisition, while simultaneously controlling for plant host identity. We grew two co-occurring species, Acacia rostellifera (N2-fixing and dual AM and ECM symbioses) and Melaleuca systena (AM and ECM dual symbioses), in three soils of contrasting ages (c. 0.1, 1, and 120~ka) collected along a long-term dune chronosequence in southwestern Australia. The soils differ in the type and strength of nutrient limitation, with primary productivity being limited by N (0.1~ka), co-limited by N and phosphorus (P) (1~ka), and by P (120~ka). We hypothesized that (i) within-species root colonization shifts from AM to ECM with increasing soil age, and that (ii) nodulation declines with increasing soil age, reflecting the shift from N to P limitation along the chronosequence. In both species, we observed a shift from AM to ECM root colonization with increasing soil age. In addition, nodulation in A.~rostellifera declined with increasing soil age, consistent with a shift from N to P limitation. Shifts from AM to ECM root colonization reflect strengthening P limitation and an increasing proportion of total soil P in organic forms in older soils. This might occur because ECM fungi can access organic P via extracellular phosphatases, while AM fungi do not use organic P. Our results show that plants can shift their resource allocation to different root symbionts depending on nutrient availability during ecosystem development.},

Like plants and some bacteria, fungi grow as walled cells. How do fungi, as walled organisms, not only sense contact, but also interpret the signal in a developmental context?},

  abstract = {We introduce SneakySnake, a highly parallel and highly accurate pre-alignment filter that remarkably reduces the need for computationally costly sequence alignment. The key idea of SneakySnake is to reduce the approximate string matching (ASM) problem to the single net routing (SNR) problem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in finding the optimal path that connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a special grid layout that contains obstacles. The SneakySnake algorithm quickly solves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal path to decide whether or not performing sequence alignment is necessary. Reducing the ASM problem into SNR also makes SneakySnake efficient to implement on CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs.SneakySnake significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art pre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper and SHD. For short sequences, SneakySnake accelerates Edlib (state-of-the-art implementation of Myers's bit-vector algorithm) and Parasail (state-of-the-art sequence aligner with a configurable scoring function), by up to 37.7{\texttimes} and 43.9{\texttimes} (\&gt;12{\texttimes} on average), respectively, with its CPU implementation, and by up to 413{\texttimes} and 689{\texttimes} (\&gt;400{\texttimes} on average), respectively, with FPGA and GPU acceleration. For long sequences, the CPU implementation of SneakySnake accelerates Parasail and KSW2 (sequence aligner of minimap2) by up to 979{\texttimes} (276.9{\texttimes} on average) and 91.7{\texttimes} (31.7{\texttimes} on average), respectively. As SneakySnake does not replace sequence alignment, users can still obtain all capabilities (e.g. configurable scoring functions) of the aligner of their choice, unlike existing acceleration efforts that sacrifice some aligner capabilities.https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SneakySnake.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The /tomentella-thelephora lineage is one of the most highly dominant clades among ectomycorrhizal communities worldwide. Despite its importance as a root symbiont, its fruit bodies are inconspicuous and rarely found. Knowledge regarding the diversity of Tomentella in the Neotropics is scarce, and is based largely on environmental samples. Here, we describe a new species, Tomentella brunneoincrustata, including its basidiocarp morphology, mycorrhizal anatomy, and ecology. Because knowledge of Tomentella in Mexico is scarce, we provide the first phylogenetic analysis of this genus in the country. We sequenced the nrITS region of the fungal samples, and sequenced the rbcL and trnL regions to identify the host plant. The phylogenetic analyses were conducted by Bayesian inference. The Bayesian analysis showed that several paraphyletic clades within the lineage /tomentella-thelephora are associated with Pisonieae present across tropical regions of the world. However, the ectomycorrhizae sequences from Puerto Rico, Florida, Dominica, and Mexico constituted a well-supported monophyletic clade that we denote as the ``Pisonieae-associated Neotropical Tomentella clade''. Within this clade, T. brunneoincrustata was characterized as follows: a thin crustose, strongly attached to the substrate basidiome; concolorous subiculum, undifferentiated and sterile margin; two types of subiculum hyphae; and small ({$<$}8~{$\mu$}m) globose to ellipsoid spores. This species develops in tropical dry forests, where it associates with hosts in the Pisonieae tribe within the Nyctaginaceae. The remaining Tomentella fruit body vouchers collected in temperate forests of Mexico belonged to clades related to T. atramentaria, T. pilosa, T. muricata, T. fuscocinerea, T. stuposa, T. punicea, T. atroarenicolor, T. bryophila, and T. lateritia. Five fruit body vouchers had unique sequences forming independent and unknown clades of Tomentella.},

Recent advances in pyrosequencing technology provide read lengths of up to 240 nucleotides. Amplicon pyrosequencing can now be applied to longer variable regions of the SSU rRNA gene including the V9 region in eukaryotes. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a protocol for the amplicon pyrosequencing of V9 regions for eukaryotic environmental samples for biodiversity inventories and species richness estimation. The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) and the Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites (MIRADA-LTERs) projects are already employing this protocol for tag sequencing of eukaryotic samples in a wide diversity of both marine and freshwater environments.

  abstract = {Abstract Pyrosequencing technologies have revolutionized how we describe and compare complex microbial communities. In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, the abundance of reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted as a measure of genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample processing, amplification and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R2 of 0.96?0.54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but between-species comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons has facilitated understanding of complex microbial communities, but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur's ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from https://github.com/biocore/deblur. IMPORTANCE Deblur provides a rapid and sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by differentiation of closely related taxa. This algorithm provides a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological differences between taxa whose amplicons differ by a single base pair, is applicable in an automated fashion to large-scale sequencing data sets, and can integrate sequencing runs collected over time.},

The method of Freedman \& Lane (1983) is found to have asymptotic correlation 1 with the exact test, and the other methods are found to have smaller correlations with this test. Under local alternatives the critical values of all the approximate permutation tests converge to the same constant, so they all have the same asymptotic power.

The drawback to this approach for fungi is that 18S rRNA sequences often do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to allow identification of taxa in mixed communities to genus or species level. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are known to be more taxonomically informative than 18S rRNA sequences and are the common target in DNA based studies but are thought to be absent from RNA pools as they are cleaved after transcription of the large rRNA precursor molecule to leave the mature rRNA's for ribosome synthesis. Here we show, however, that fungal ITS regions can be detected in RNA pools by RT-PCR amplification of fungal precursor rRNA molecules. This suggests that precursor rRNA molecules reside in the cells of active fungi for sufficient time to allow RT-PCR amplification of ITS regions prior to their removal by post-transcriptional cleavage. The RT-PCR conditions for this approach were initially optimised using a range of fungi grown in pure culture prior to applying the approach to complex fungal communities in two contrasting soil types.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sporocarp production is essential for ectomycorrhizal fungal recombination and dispersal, which influences fungal community dynamics. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) affect host plant carbon gain and allocation, which may in turn influence ectomycorrhizal sporocarp production if the carbon available to the ectomycorrhizal fungus is dependant upon the quantity of carbon assimilated by the host. We measured sporocarp production of ectomycorrhizal fungi over 4?years at the Aspen FACE (free air CO2 enrichment) site, which corresponded to stand ages seven to 10?years. Total mean sporocarp biomass was greatest under elevated CO2, regardless of O3 concentration, while it was generally lowest under elevated O3 with ambient CO2. Community composition differed significantly among the treatments, with less difference in the final year of the study. Whether this convergence was due to succession or environmental factors is uncertain. CO2 and O3 affect ectomycorrhizal sporocarp productivity and community composition, with likely effects on dispersal, colonization and sporocarp-dependent food webs.},

Here we describe the process of assembling a pan-European mycological meta-database (ClimFun) and integrating it with open-source data to advance the fields of macroecology and biogeography against a backdrop of global change. Initially 7.3 million unique fungal species fruit body records, spanning nine countries, were processed and assembled into 6 million records of more than 10,000 species. This is an extraordinary amount of fungal data to address macro-ecological questions. We provide two examples of fungal species with different life histories, one ectomycorrhizal and one wood decaying, to demonstrate how such continental-scale meta-databases can offer unique insights into climate change effects on fungal phenology and fruiting patterns in recent decades.},

  abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, \& Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325--337, 2000) and JAGS (Plummer, 2003) provide ``turnkey''-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan (Stan Development Team, 2015) can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153--178. doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002, 2008).},

Although the bioinformatics may be applied using several public tools, many analytical pipelines allow too few options for the optimal analysis for more complicated or customized designs. Here, we introduce PipeCraft, a flexible and handy bioinformatics pipeline with a user-friendly graphical interface that links several public tools for analysing amplicon sequencing data. Users are able to customize the pipeline by selecting the most suitable tools and options to process raw sequences from Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, Ion Torrent and Roche 454 sequencing platforms. We described the design and options of PipeCraft and evaluated its performance by analysing the data sets from three different sequencing platforms. We demonstrated that PipeCraft is able to process large data sets within 24 hr. The graphical user interface and the automated links between various bioinformatics tools enable easy customization of the workflow. All analytical steps and options are recorded in log files and are easily traceable.},

An objective of our study was to quantify ergosterol in a range of ectomycorrhizal isolates under differing growth conditions. In addition, we tested the applicability of the method on field-collected roots of ectomycorrhizal and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal plants. Quantification of sitosterol as a biomass indicator of plant roots was also undertaken. Ergosterol was not detected in roots of uninoculated Betula populifolia seedlings, and sitosterol was not detected in an ectomycorrhizal fungal isolate but was present in birch roots. Ergosterol was produced in all isolates examined, which represented the major orders of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The range of values obtained, from 3 to nearly 18 {$\mu$}g ergosterol mg-1 dry mass, agrees well with reported values for other mycorrhizal and decomposer fungi. Hyphal ergosterol was the same during growth on phytic acid and KH2PO4. Reduction of growth temperature from 25{$^\circ$} C to 15{$^\circ$} C had little effect on ergosterol content of cultures harvested at similar growth stages. Ergosterol and sitosterol were detected in field-collected ectomycorrhizae of B. populifolia and Pinus sylvestris and VA mycorrhizae of Acer rubrum and Plantago major. Both ergosterol content and ergosterol to sitosterol ratios were significantly lower in VA mycorrhizae than ectomycorrhizae. Calculations of viable fungal biomass associated with field-collected roots were in agreement with those reported by others using the method on resynthesized ectomycorrhizae. Estimates of total mass could be obtained for field-collected B. populifolia roots by a simultaneously using ergosterol to estimate fungal biomass and sitosterol to estimate root mass. Some potential applications and limitations of sterol quantification in studies of mycorrhizal physiology and ecology are discussed.},

One such issue concerns the treatment of reads by denoising or by clustering methods, which have been wrongly presented as alternatives. It has also been suggested that denoised sequence variants should replace clusters as the basic unit of metabarcoding analyses, missing the fact that sequence clusters are a proxy for species-level entities, the basic unit in biodiversity studies. We argue here that methods developed and tested for ribosomal markers have been uncritically applied to highly variable markers such as cytochrome oxidase I (COI) without conceptual or operational (e.g., parameter setting) adjustment. COI has a naturally high intraspecies variability that should be assessed and reported, as it is a source of highly valuable information. We contend that denoising and clustering are not alternatives. Rather, they are complementary and both should be used together in COI metabarcoding pipelines.},

Appendiculati) are an economically important group of ectomycorrhizal fungi whose basidiocarps have a yellow tube layer that often bruises blue, yellow reticulate stipe, mild flavor and firm yellow-tinged flesh that may or may not turn blue when exposed. Morphological characters and molecular data (ITS and LSU) place this group in a separate phylogenetic clade from Boletus sensu stricto. Here we establish a new genus, Butyriboletus, to accommodate 14 species of butter boletes that range from Asia to Europe, north Africa and North America. We recombine eight previously described butter bolete species and we describe six new species: four from western USA (Bu. persolidus, Bu. primiregius, Bu. autumnigius, Bu. querciregius) and two from Yunnan, China (Bu. yicibus, Bu. sanicibus).},

  abstract = {Fens occur in many Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds that have historically been affected by metal mining activities. A persistent effect of mining is acid rock drainage (ARD), which flows from mine adits and tailings piles. ARD water has low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals and can pollute surface and ground water supporting fens. There are few floristic differences between polluted and pristine fens, and it is unclear what long-term affects ARD has on fens. We investigated decomposition of native leaf litter and a standard litter for two years in fourCarex aquatilis-dominated subalpine fens. Two of the fens are affected by ARD, and their source waters have pH {$<$}4.0 and high concentrations of dissolved Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb. The other two fens are relatively pristine, with source water pH {$>$} 6.0 and low metal concentrations. ARD significantly reduced native litter decomposition rates over two years (ANOVA, p {$<$}0.01) with 63\% of the initial mass of leaf litter remaining at the most pristine site (Peru Creek fen), 47 \% at a moderately polluted site (Argentine fen), and 23\% at the most pristine site (Deer Creek fen). ARD also reduced the quality of litter produced. Standard litter decomposed more rapidly than native litter at all sites, particularly Peru Creek fen. Site, representing fen environment, and litter origin, representing native vs. standard litter, significantly affected decomposition rates (ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.0001) Pristine fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal rich fens, while polluted fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal poor fens and bogs. Acid rock drainage causes ecosystem-level responses in organic matter processing, peat accumulation rates, and most likely in nutrient cycling, which could have long-term affects on fen primary and secondary production and other functions.},

  abstract = {In structural alignments of RNA sequences, the computational cost of Sankoff algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes the score of the common secondary structure and the score of the alignment, is too high for long sequences (O(L 6) time for two sequences of length L). In this chapter, we introduce the methods that predict the structures and the alignment separately to avoid the heavy computations in Sankoff algorithm. In those methods, neither of those two prediction processes is independent, but each of them utilizes the information of the other process. The first process typically includes prediction of base-pairing probabilities (BPPs) or the candidates of the stems, and the alignment process utilizes those results. At the same time, it is also important to reflect the information of the alignment to the structure prediction. This idea can be implemented as the probabilistic transformation (PCT) of BPPs using the potential alignment. As same as for all the estimation problems, it is important to define the evaluation measure for the structural alignment. The principle of maximum expected accuracy (MEA) is applicable for sum-of-pairs (SPS) score based on the reference alignment.},

  abstract = {A new computer program, called Mallard, is presented for screening entire 16S rRNA gene libraries of up to 1,000 sequences for chimeras and other artifacts. Written in the Java computer language and capable of running on all major operating systems, the program provides a novel graphical approach for visualizing phylogenetic relationships among 16S rRNA gene sequences. To illustrate its use, we analyzed most of the large libraries of cloned bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences submitted to the public repository during 2005. Defining a large library as one containing 100 or more sequences of 1,200 bases or greater, we screened 25 of the 28 libraries and found that all but three contained substantial anomalies. Overall, 543 anomalous sequences were found. The average anomaly content per clone library was 9.0\%, 4\% higher than that previously estimated for the public repository overall. In addition, 90.8\% of anomalies had characteristic chimeric patterns, a rise of 25.4\% over that found previously. One library alone was found to contain 54 chimeras, representing 45.8\% of its content. These figures far exceed previous estimates of artifacts within public repositories and further highlight the urgent need for all researchers to adequately screen their libraries prior to submission.

  abstract = {The Sudanian woodlands (SW) and Zambezian woodlands (ZW) of Africa cover two extensive vegetation zones in Africa. The main question is how similar or different are their woodlands. This paper aims to synthesize available information on woodlands of the Sudanian (SR) and Zambezian (ZR) regions in terms of: i) their floristics and ecology, ii) main drivers of change, iii) their socio-economic relevance to local populations, and iv) how resource use affects the main drivers. This synthesis deals with 141 publications, including 94\% research articles and books on Sudanian and Zambezian woodlands of Africa. Google Scholar's search engine were used. Inclusion criteria comprised the geographical focus (Sudanian and Zambezian regions), the ecosystem type (woodland), and the type of information reported in the studies (ecology, socio-economic and biogeography aspects). The overall results were categorized as addressing either ecological or socio-economic aspects of woodlands. The SW and ZW share a number of families, genera and species. The ZR counts at least 8500 plant species, of which 54\% are endemic, while there are possibly no more than 2750 plant species in the SR. Three distinct woodland types are ecologically important and clearly differentiated in the ZW. However, combined effect of the wide tolerances of the species and the gradual change in the climate in the SZ, makes it difficult to recognize distinct woodland systems. The presence of great rifts and swells in the Zambezian part of Africa, explain in part the difference in the vegetation composition and the high diversity and plant endemism in the Zambezian zones. In both Regions, use of woodland and the associated ecological impacts are quite similar. Both biogeography and land use change explain the vegetation differences between the two regions. Knowledge of factors underlying vegetation adaptations and change provide a basis for sustainable resource use through integrated multiple-use systems.},

  abstract = {The global accelerating loss of biodiversity is having immediate repercussions for ecosystems and human wellbeing, particularly in areas where people depend intimately on their natural environment for their livelihoods. Dovetailing this loss is the demise of local/traditional knowledge systems resulting from factors such as changing lifestyle and the transformation of local belief systems. While the importance of local ecological knowledge (LEK) for documentation of biodiversity and environmental change and development of management responses is well established, quantitative tools to analyze and systematically compare LEK are scarce. In this research, we analyze the complexity of local ecological knowledge used by respondents to classify locally-recognized marine species. We do so by applying a modified index of taxonomic distinctness to an ethnoichthyological classification in coastal communities in the Solomon Islands. In addition, we assess simple taxonomic diversity (richness in locally-recognized species names) by comparing taxonomies collected in 1992--1995 and 2014--2015. Results indicate that both endogenous (gender, age) and exogenous (proximity to market) factors have discernible effects on folk taxonomic knowledge in the region, with younger respondents and communities closer to a regional market center displaying a significantly lower richness of local species names. Folk taxonomic distinctness was significantly reduced closer to the regional market. The modified index of taxonomic distinctness applied in this research provides a useful tool to explore facets of local ecological knowledge in addition to simple richness of terms, and to compare across different regions and cultural backgrounds. Understanding changes in LEK is important because such knowledge enables communities who are highly dependent on living natural resources to harvest and manage resources more efficiently and also to detect and react to environmental change.},

  abstract = {Molecular and morphological evidence points to the ancyromonad Ancyromonas as a plausible candidate for the closest relative to the common ancestor of metazoans, fungi, and choanoflagellates (the Opisthokonta). Using 18S rDNA sequences from most of the major eukaryotic lineages, maximum-likelihood, minimum-evolution, and maximum-parsimony analyses yielded congruent phylogenies supporting this hypothesis. Combined with ultrastructural similarities between Ancyromonas and opisthokonts, the evidence presented here suggests that Ancyromonas may form an independent lineage, the Ancyromonadida Cavalier-Smith 1997, closer in its relationship to the opisthokonts than is its nearest protist relatives, the Apusomonadida. However, the very low bootstrap support for deep nodes and hypothesis testing indicate that the resolving power of 18S rDNA sequences is limited for examining this aspect of eukaryotic phylogeny. Alternate branching positions for the Ancyromonas lineage cannot be robustly rejected, revealing the importance of ultrastructure when examining the origins of multicellularity. The future use of a multigene approach may additionally be needed to resolve this aspect of eukaryotic phylogeny.},

  abstract = {Background: Boletus griseipurpureus Corner, an edible mushroom, is a putative ectomycorrhizal fungus. Currently, the taxonomic boundary of this mushroom is unclear and its bitter taste makes it interesting for evaluating its antibacterial properties. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic variation of this mushroom and also to evaluate any antibacterial activities. Materials and Methods: Basidiocarps were collected from 2 north-eastern provinces, Roi Et and Ubon Ratchathani, and from 2 southern provinces, Songkhla and Surat Thani, in Thailand. Genomic DNA was extracted and molecular structure was examined using the RNA polymerase II (RPB2) analysis. Antibacterial activities of basidiocarp extracts were conducted with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29523 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 189 using the agar-well diffusion method. Results: All the samples collected for this study constituted a monophyletic clade, which was closely related with the Boletus group of polypore fungi. For the antibacterial study, it was found that the crude methanol extract of basidiomes inhibited the growth of all bacteria in vitro more than the crude ethyl acetate extract. Conclusions: Basidomes collected from four locations in Thailand had low genetic variation and their extracts inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria. The health benefits of this edible species should be evaluated further.},

  abstract = {The episodic nature of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has significant consequences on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control belowground processes through soil wet-dry cycles. Rapid soil microbial response to incident moisture availability often results in almost instantaneous C and N mineralization, followed by shifts in C/N of microbially available substrate, and an offset in the balance between nutrient immobilization and mineralization. Nitrogen inputs from biological soil crusts are also highly sensitive to pulsed rain events, and nitrogen losses, particularly gaseous losses due to denitrification and nitrate leaching, are tightly linked to pulses of water availability. The magnitude of the effect of water pulses on carbon and nutrient pools, however, depends on the distribution of resource availability and soil organisms, both of which are strongly affected by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and soil texture. The `inverse texture hypothesis' for net primary production in water-limited ecosystems suggests that coarse-textured soils have higher NPP than fine-textured soils in very arid zones due to reduced evaporative losses, while NPP is greater in fine-textured soils in higher rainfall ecosystems due to increased water-holding capacity. With respect to belowground processes, fine-textured soils tend to have higher water-holding capacity and labile C and N pools than coarse-textured soils, and often show a much greater flush of N mineralization. The result of the interaction of texture and pulsed rainfall events suggests a corollary hypothesis for nutrient turnover in arid and semiarid ecosystems with a linear increase of N mineralization in coarse-textured soils, but a saturating response for fine-textured soils due to the importance of soil C and N pools. Seasonal distribution of water pulses can lead to the accumulation of mineral N in the dry season, decoupling resource supply and microbial and plant demand, and resulting in increased losses via other pathways and reduction in overall soil nutrient pools. The asynchrony of resource availability, particularly nitrogen versus water due to pulsed water events, may be central to understanding the consequences for ecosystem nutrient retention and long-term effects on carbon and nutrient pools. Finally, global change effects due to changes in the nature and size of pulsed water events and increased asynchrony of water availability and growing season will likely have impacts on biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems.},

Understanding the processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent work has suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free-living microbial decomposers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems globally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here we show that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67\% under field conditions in two separate field exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via competition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 {$^\circ$}C soil warming. These findings support mycorrhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstrate the need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global climate.},

Yet, our knowledge of temporal controls is comparatively limited. This is a major uncertainty in microbial ecology, as there is increasing evidence that microbial community composition is important for predicting microbial community function in the future. Here, we use continental- and global-scale soil fungal community surveys, focused within northern temperate latitudes, to estimate the relative contribution of time and space to soil fungal community turnover. We detected large intra-annual temporal differences in soil fungal community similarity, where fungal communities differed most among seasons, equivalent to the community turnover observed over thousands of kilometers in space. inter-annual community turnover was comparatively smaller than intra-annual turnover. Certain environmental covariates, particularly climate covariates, explained some spatial--temporal effects, though it is unlikely the same mechanisms drive spatial vs. temporal turnover. However, these commonly measured environmental covariates could not fully explain relationships between space, time and community composition. These baseline estimates of fungal community turnover in time provide a starting point to estimate the potential duration of legacies in microbial community composition and function.},

  abstract = {The transition towards graph pangenomes is posing several new challenging questions, most notably how to extend the classical notion of read alignment from a sequence-to-sequence to a sequence-to-graph setting. Especially on variation graphs, where paths corresponding to individual genomes are labeled, notions of alignments that are strongly inspired by the classical ones are usually able to capture only variations that can be expressed by mismatches or gaps, such as SNPs or short insertions and deletions. On the other hand the recent investigation of pangenomes at bacterial scale (Colquhoun et al, 2021) shows that most tools are tailored for human pangenomes and are not suited to bacteria which exhibit, among other characteristics, a larger variability. Such variability leads to the need for incorporating a greater flexibility when computing an alignment. In this paper, we extend the usual notion of sequence-to-graph alignment by including recombinations among the variations that explicitly represented and evaluated in an alignment. From a computational modeling point of view, a recombination corresponds to identifying a new path of the variation graph which is a mosaic of two different paths, possibly joined by a new arc. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for computing an optimal alignment that allows recombinations with an affine penalty. We have implemented our approach with the tool RecGraph and we have analyzed its accuracy over some over some bacterial pangenome graphs.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the impact of plantation monocultures of fast-growing exotic species and indigenous tree species on nutrient cycling in West Africa. The rates of nutrient uptake and recycling to the soil vary with tree species and ecological zones. In general, single species tree plantations immobilize soil nutrients faster and return less nutrients to the soil than native forest and savanna vegetation. Hence, they deplete soil nutrients. Plantations of an indigenous species, Terminalia ivorensis, exert less deleterious effects on soil nutrient status than exotics such as teak and gmelina. Owing to their effects in destabilising the nutrient cycle in forest and savanna ecosystems, the plantation monocultures of fast-growing tree species are not likely to be sustainable in the long term. The widespread adoption of plantation forestry as an alternative to the natural regeneration of native forests as a strategy for increasing the wood resources of humid tropics is, therefore, indicative of an uncritical acceptance of the view that monocultural tree plantations are sustainable. There is need for caution in the rush to convert native ecosystems, especially rain forests, into plantations of fast-growing exotic trees.},

  abstract = {Abstract The classification of the legume family proposed here addresses the long-known non-monophyly of the traditionally recognised subfamily Caesalpinioideae, by recognising six robustly supported monophyletic subfamilies. This new classification uses as its framework the most comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of legumes to date, based on plastid matK gene sequences, and including near-complete sampling of genera (698 of the currently recognised 765 genera) and ca. 20\% (3696) of known species. The matK gene region has been the most widely sequenced across the legumes, and in most legume lineages, this gene region is sufficiently variable to yield well-supported clades. This analysis resolves the same major clades as in other phylogenies of whole plastid and nuclear gene sets (with much sparser taxon sampling). Our analysis improves upon previous studies that have used large phylogenies of the Leguminosae for addressing evolutionary questions, because it maximises generic sampling and provides a phylogenetic tree that is based on a fully curated set of sequences that are vouchered and taxonomically validated. The phylogenetic trees obtained and the underlying data are available to browse and download, facilitating subsequent analyses that require evolutionary trees. Here we propose a new community-endorsed classification of the family that reflects the phylogenetic structure that is consistently resolved and recognises six subfamilies in Leguminosae: a recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae DC., Cercidoideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Detarioideae Burmeist., Dialioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), Duparquetioideae Legume Phylogeny Working Group (stat. nov.), and Papilionoideae DC. The traditionally recognised subfamily Mimosoideae is a distinct clade nested within the recircumscribed Caesalpinioideae and is referred to informally as the mimosoid clade pending a forthcoming formal tribal and/or clade-based classification of the new Caesalpinioideae. We provide a key for subfamily identification, descriptions with diagnostic charactertistics for the subfamilies, figures illustrating their floral and fruit diversity, and lists of genera by subfamily. This new classification of Leguminosae represents a consensus view of the international legume systematics community; it invokes both compromise and practicality of use.},

Cet ouvrage pr{\'e}sente une synth{\`e}se des travaux sur les champignons ectomycorhiziens conduits par l'IRD et ses partenaires en Afrique de l'Ouest. Outre des donn{\'e}es fondamentales sur la diversit{\'e} et l'{\'e}cologie de la symbiose, cet ouvrage d{\'e}crit les m{\'e}thodes d'{\'e}tude des champignons, en particulier les techniques de mycorhization contr{\^o}l{\'e}e, pratique sylvicole utilis{\'e}e pour la production de plants forestiers. Un chapitre est consacr{\'e} aux champignons comestibles, source de nourriture appr{\'e}ci{\'e}e des populations qui peut {\'e}galement contribuer au d{\'e}veloppement socio-{\'e}conomique r{\'e}gional. L'ouvrage s'adresse {\`a} un large public ({\'e}tudiants, chercheurs, enseignants, gestionnaires de l'environnement, d{\'e}cideurs) et constitue une r{\'e}f{\'e}rence actualis{\'e}e sur les symbioses ectomycorhiziennes et leur impact dans les {\'e}cosyst{\`e}mes forestiers ouest-africains.},

  abstract = {The diversity, ecology and function of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and ectomycorrhizas (ECMs) on tropical African tree species are reviewed here. While ECMs are the most frequent mycorrhizal type in temperate and boreal forests, they concern an economically and ecologically important minority of plants in African tropical forests. In these African tropical forests, ECMs are found mainly on caesalpionioid legumes, Sarcolaenaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Asterpeiaceae, Phyllantaceae, Sapotaceae, Papilionoideae, Gnetaceae and Proteaceae, and distributed in open, gallery and rainforests of the Guineo-Congolian basin, Zambezian Miombo woodlands of East and South-Central Africa and Sudanian savannah woodlands of the sub-sahara. Overall, EM status was confirmed in 93 (26\%) among 354 tree species belonging to EM genera. In addition, 195 fungal taxa were identified using morphological descriptions and sequencing of the ML5/ML6 fragment of sporocarps and ECMs from West Africa. Analyses of the belowground EM fungal communities mostly based on fungal internal transcribed spacer sequences of ECMs from Continental Africa, Madagascar and the Seychelles also revealed more than 350 putative species of EM fungi belonging mainly to 18 phylogenetic lineages. As in temperate forests, the /russula--lactarius and /tomentella--thelephora lineages dominated EM fungal flora in tropical Africa. A low level of host preference and dominance of multi-host fungal taxa on different African adult tree species and their seedlings were revealed, suggesting a potential for the formation of common ectomycorrhizal networks. Moreover, the EM inoculum potential in terms of types and density of propagules (spores, sclerotia, EM root fragments and fragments of mycelia strands) in the soil allowed opportunistic root colonisation as well as long-term survival in the soil during the dry season. These are important characteristics when choosing an EM fungus for field application. In this respect, Thelephoroid fungal sp. XM002, an efficient and competitive broad host range EM fungus, possessed these characteristics and appeared to be a good candidate for artificial inoculation of Caesalps and Phyllanthaceae seedlings in nurseries. However, further efforts should be made to assess the genetic and functional diversity of African EM fungi as well as the EM status of unstudied plant species and to strengthen the use of efficient and competitive EM fungi to improve production of ecologically and economically important African multipurpose trees in plantations.},

  abstract = {We have compared the total microbial biomass and the fungal/bacterial ratio estimated using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) in combination with the selective inhibition technique and using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technique in a pH gradient (3.0--7.2) consisting of 53 mature broad-leaved forest soils. A fungal/bacterial biomass index using the PLFA technique was calculated using the PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 as an indicator of fungal biomass and the sum of 13 bacterial specific PLFAs as indicator of the bacterial biomass. Good linear correlation (p{$<$}0.001) was found between the total microbial biomass estimated with SIR and total PLFAs (totPLFA), indicating that 1 mg biomass-C was equivalent to 130nmol totPLFA. Both biomass estimates were positively correlated to soil pH. The fungal/bacterial ratio measured using the selective inhibition technique decreased significantly with increasing pH from about 9 at pH 3 to approximately 2 at pH 7, while the fungal/bacterial biomass index using PLFA measurements tended to increase slightly with increasing soil pH. Good correlation between the soil content of ergosterol and of the PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 indicated that the lack of congruency between the two methods in estimating fungal/bacterial ratios was not due to PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9-related non-fungal structures to any significant degree. Several PLFAs were strongly correlated to soil pH (R2 values {$>$}0.8); for example the PLFAs 16:1{$\omega$}5 and 16:1{$\omega$}7c increased with increasing soil pH, while i16:0 and cy19:0 decreased. A principal component analysis of the total PLFA pattern gave a first component that was strongly correlated to soil pH (R2=0.85, p{$<$}0.001) indicating that the microbial community composition in these beech/beech-oak forest soils was to a large extent determined by soil pH.},

  abstract = {We describe different tools and approaches for RNA--RNA interaction prediction. Recognition of ncRNA targets is predominantly governed by two principles, namely the stability of the duplex between the two interacting RNAs and the internal structure of both mRNA and ncRNA. Thus, approaches can be distinguished into different major categories depending on how they consider inter- and intramolecular structure. The first class completely neglects the internal structure and measures only the stability of the duplex. The second class of approaches abstracts from specific intramolecular structures and uses an ensemble-based approach to calculate the effect of internal structure on a putative binding site, thus measuring the accessibility of the binding sites.Since accessibility-based approaches can handle only one continuous interaction site, two addition types of approaches were introduced which predict a joint structure for the interacting RNAs. Since this problem is NP-complete, the approaches can handle only a restricted class of joint structures. The first are co-folding approaches, which predict a joint structure that is nested when the both sequences are concatenated. The last and most complex class of approaches impose only the restriction that they discard zipper-like structures. Finally, we will discuss the use of conservation information in RNA-target prediction.},

The emergence of DNA-based tools has expanded the geographic and taxonomic scope of studies examining spatial and temporal distribution of mycorrhizal fungi. However, the nature of spatiotemporal patterns documented and subsequent interpretation of ecological processes can vary significantly from study to study. In order to look for general patterns we synthesize the available data across different sampling scales and mycorrhizal types. The results of this analysis shed light on the relative importance of space, time and vertical soil structure on community variability across different mycorrhizal types. Although we found no significant trend in spatiotemporal variation among mycorrhizal types, the vertical community variation was distinctly greater than the spatial and temporal variability in mycorrhizal fungal communities. Both spatial and temporal variability of communities was greater in topsoil compared with lower horizons, suggesting that greater environmental heterogeneity drives community variation on a fine scale. This further emphasizes the importance of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering in maintaining diverse fungal communities.},

However, little is known about genomic and microbiome features of most uncultured symbiotic fungal clades. Here, we analysed the genome and microbiome of Inocybaceae (Agaricales, Basidiomycota), a largely uncultured ectomycorrhizal clade known to form symbiotic associations with a wide variety of plant species. We used metagenomic sequencing and assembly of dikaryotic fruiting-body tissues from Inocybe terrigena (Fr.) Kuyper, to classify fungal and bacterial genomic sequences, and obtained a nearly complete fungal genome containing 93\% of core eukaryotic genes. Comparative genomics reveals that I. terrigena is more similar to ectomycorrhizal and brown rot fungi than to white rot fungi. The reduction in lignin degradation capacity has been independent from and significantly faster than in closely related ectomycorrhizal clades supporting that ectomycorrhizal symbiosis evolved independently in Inocybe. The microbiome of I. terrigena fruiting-bodies includes bacteria with known symbiotic functions in other fungal and non-fungal host environments, suggesting potential symbiotic functions of these bacteria in fungal tissues regardless of habitat conditions. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of direct metagenomics analysis of fruiting-body tissues for characterizing fungal genomes and microbiome.},

However, proper quantification of archaeal diversity and community ecology remains limited, as sequence coverage of Archaea is usually low owing to the inability of available prokaryotic primers to efficiently amplify archaeal compared to bacterial rRNA genes. To improve identification and quantification of Archaea, we designed and validated the utility of several primer pairs to efficiently amplify archaeal 16S rRNA genes based on up-to-date reference genes. We demonstrate that several of these primer pairs amplify phylogenetically diverse Archaea with high sequencing coverage, outperforming commonly used primers. Based on comparing the resulting long 16S rRNA gene fragments with public databases from all habitats, we found several novel family- to phylum-level archaeal taxa from topsoil and surface water. Our results suggest that archaeal diversity has been largely overlooked due to the limitations of available primers, and that improved primer pairs enable to estimate archaeal diversity more accurately.},

Using in situ N2O measurements and by determining the structure and potential functional of microbial communities in 645 wetland soil samples globally, we examined the potential role of archaea, bacteria, and fungi in nitrogen (N) cycling and N2O emissions. We show that N2O emissions are higher in drained and warm wetland soils, and are correlated with functional diversity of microbes. We further provide evidence that despite their much lower abundance compared to bacteria, nitrifying archaeal abundance is a key factor explaining N2O emissions from wetland soils globally. Our data suggest that ongoing global warming and intensifying environmental change may boost archaeal nitrifiers, collectively transforming wetland soils to a greater source of N2O.},

  abstract = {To appreciate the functional diversity of communities of soil eukaryotic micro-organisms we evaluated an experimental approach based on the construction and screening of a cDNA library using polyadenylated mRNA extracted from a forest soil. Such a library contains genes that are expressed by each of the different organisms forming the community and represents its metatranscriptome. The diversity of the organisms that contributed to this library was evaluated by sequencing a portion of the 18S rDNA gene amplified from either soil DNA or reverse-transcribed RNA. More than 70\% of the sequences were from fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) while the other most represented group was the metazoa. Calculation of richness estimators suggested that more than 180 species could be present in the soil samples studied. Sequencing of 119 cDNA identified genes with no homologues in databases (32\%) and genes coding proteins involved in different biochemical and cellular processes. Surprisingly, the taxonomic distribution of the cDNA and of the 18S rDNA genes did not coincide, with a marked under-representation of the protists among the cDNA. Specific genes from such an environmental cDNA library could be isolated by expression in a heterologous microbial host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is illustrated by the functional complementation of a histidine auxotrophic yeast mutant by two cDNA originating possibly from an ascomycete and a basidiomycete fungal species. Study of the metatranscriptome has the potential to uncover adaptations of whole microbial communities to local environmental conditions. It also gives access to an abundant source of genes of biotechnological interest.},

However, inclusion of appropriate controls is vital to revealing the limitations and biases of this technique. ?Mock community? samples, in which the composition and relative abundances of community members are known, are particularly valuable for guiding library preparation and data processing decisions. I generated a set of three mock communities using 19 different fungal taxa and demonstrate their utility by contrasting amplicon sequencing data obtained for the same communities under modifications to PCR conditions during library preparation. Increasing the number of PCR cycles elevated rates of chimera formation, and of errors in the final data set. Extension time during PCR had little impact on chimera formation, error rate or observed community structure. Polymerase fidelity impacted error rates significantly. Despite a high error rate, a master mix optimized to minimize amplification bias yielded profiles that were most similar to the true community structure. Bias against particular taxa differed among ITS1 vs. ITS2 loci. Preclustering nearly identical reads substantially reduced error rates, but did not improve similarity to the expected community structure. Inaccuracies in amplicon sequence-based estimates of fungal community structure were associated with amplification bias and size selection processes, as well as variable culling rates among reads from different taxa. In some cases, the numerically dominant taxon was completely absent from final data sets, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements to avoid biased observations of community profiles.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic placement of query samples on an existing phylogeny is increasingly used in molecular ecology, including sample identification and microbiome environmental sampling. As the size of available reference trees used in these analyses continues to grow, there is a growing need for methods that place sequences on ultra-large trees with high accuracy. Distance-based placement methods have recently emerged as a path to provide such scalability while allowing flexibility to analyse both assembled and unassembled environmental samples. In this study, we introduce a distance-based phylogenetic placement method, APPLES-2, that is more accurate and scalable than existing distance-based methods and even some of the leading maximum-likelihood methods. This scalability is owed to a divide-and-conquer technique that limits distance calculation and phylogenetic placement to parts of the tree most relevant to each query. The increased scalability and accuracy enables us to study the effectiveness of APPLES-2 for placing microbial genomes on a data set of 10,575 microbial species using subsets of 381 marker genes. APPLES-2 has very high accuracy in this setting, placing 97\% of query genomes within three branches of the optimal position in the species tree using 50 marker genes. Our proof-of-concept results show that APPLES-2 can quickly place metagenomic scaffolds on ultra-large backbone trees with high accuracy as long as a scaffold includes tens of marker genes. These results pave the path for a more scalable and widespread use of distance-based placement in various areas of molecular ecology.},

By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils.},

Despite limitations, high-throughput sequencing is nowadays a predominant method to characterize the alpha and beta diversity of fungal communities. Across the papers utilizing high-throughput sequencing approaches to study natural habitats in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide,\,{$>$}\,200 studies published until 2019 have generated over 250 million sequences of the primary mycological metabarcoding marker, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Here we show that at a 97\% sequence similarity threshold, the total richness of non-singleton fungal taxa across the studies published so far is 1.08 million, mostly Ascomycota (56.8\% of the taxa) and Basidiomycota (36.7\% of the taxa). The Chao-1 estimate of the total extant fungal diversity based on this dataset is 6.28 million taxa, representing a conservative estimate of global fungal species richness. Soil and litter represent the habitats with the highest alpha diversity of fungi followed by air, plant shoots, plant roots and deadwood with Chao-1 predictions, for samples containing 5000 sequences, of 1219, 569, 392, 228, 215 and 140 molecular species, respectively. Based on the high-throughput sequencing data, the highest proportion of unknown fungal species is associated with samples of lichen and plant tissues. When considering the use of high-throughput sequencing for the estimation of global fungal diversity, the limitations of the method have to be taken into account, some of which are sequencing platform-specific while others are inherent to the metabarcoding approaches of species representation. In this respect, high-throughput sequencing data can complement fungal diversity predictions based on methods of traditional mycology and increase our understanding of fungal biodiversity.},

The majority of studies use established short-read high-throughput sequencing platforms. The Oxford Nanopore MinIONTM, a portable sequencing platform, represents a low-cost alternative allowing researchers to generate sequence data in the field. However, a major drawback is the high raw read error rate that can range from 10\% to 22\%. To test whether the MinIONTM represents a viable alternative to other sequencing platforms, we used rolling circle amplification (RCA) to generate full-length consensus DNA barcodes for a bulk mock sample of 50 aquatic invertebrate species with at least 15\% genetic distance to each other. By applying two different laboratory protocols, we generated two MinIONTM runs that were used to build error-corrected consensus sequences. A newly developed Python pipeline, ASHURE, was used for data processing, consensus building, clustering and taxonomic assignment of the resulting reads. Our pipeline achieved median accuracies of up to 99.3\% for long concatemeric reads ({$>$}45 barcodes) and successfully identified all 50 species in the mock community. The use of RCA was integral for increasing consensus accuracy but was also the most time-consuming step of the laboratory workflow. Most concatemeric reads were skewed towards a shorter read length range with a median read length of up to 1,262 bp. Our study demonstrates that Nanopore sequencing can be used for metabarcoding, but exploration of other isothermal amplification procedures to improve consensus accuracy is recommended.},

The ITS has already been proposed and widely used as universal barcode marker for plants, but a comprehensive, updated and accurate reference dataset of plant ITS sequences has not been available so far. Here, we constructed reference datasets of Viridiplantae ITS1, ITS2 and entire ITS sequences including both Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. The sequences were retrieved from NCBI, and the ITS region was extracted. The sequences underwent identity check to remove misidentified records and were clustered at 99\% identity to reduce redundancy and computational effort. For this step, we developed a script called `better clustering for QIIME' (bc4q) to ensure that the representative sequences are chosen according to the composition of the cluster at a different taxonomic level. The three datasets obtained with the bc4q script are PLANiTS1 (100\,224 sequences), PLANiTS2 (96\,771 sequences) and PLANiTS (97\,550 sequences), and all are pre-formatted for QIIME, being this the most used bioinformatic pipeline for metabarcoding analysis. Being curated and updated reference databases, PLANiTS1, PLANiTS2 and PLANiTS are proposed as a reliable, pivotal first step for a general standardization of plant DNA metabarcoding studies. The bc4q script is presented as a new tool useful in each research dealing with sequences clustering.Database URL: https://github.com/apallavicini/bc4q; https://github.com/apallavicini/PLANiTS.},

  abstract = {The dikaryon is the persistent vegetative phase of most basidiomycetes and arises by cell fusion of two haploids carrying different mating type alleles. The diplophase is restricted to a single cell (the basidium) where meiosis takes place. Cell fusion and karyogamy are thus temporally and spatially separated. The dikaryon is characterized by the presence in each cell of two genetically distinct nuclei in a 1:1 ratio and by clamp connections, structures involved in partitioning of the nuclei during their synchronous division. In Coprinopsis cinerea and Schizophyllum commune, with two mating type loci (A and B), heterokaryons with identical A alleles exhibit nuclear migration but no clamps, and those with identical B alleles have unfused clamps (pseudoclamps) and no nuclear migration. Armillaria species are exceptional among basidiomycetes because of their persistent vegetative diploid phase with no clamp connections. Cell fusion is followed immediately by karyogamy. Haploidization of the diploid nucleus may occur in the fruiting body, resulting in a new dikaryophaseediplophase. Diploids in Ustilago maydis were the first to be synthesized in any basidiomycete. They played a critical role in pioneering studies on DNA recombination and repair. Subsequently diploids were generated in C. cinerea, S. commune, Microbotryum violaceum, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Dikaryons (or heterokaryons) and diploids of the same genotype exhibit phenotypic differences. The reason is not known but evidence indicates that gene expression differs when the same genetic information resides in two nuclei versus one nucleus in the same cell. Diploids in basidiomycete fungi are very stable by themselves but become unstable in 2N {\th} N or 2N {\th} 2N dikaryons. Instability results in haploidization (gradual loss of chromosomes) of the diploid nucleus. The mechanism that triggers this instability is not known.},

Likewise, it is well-established that these airborne bacteria and fungi can have myriad effects on human health, as well as the health of plants and livestock. However, we have a limited understanding of how these airborne communities vary across different geographic regions or the factors that structure the geographic patterns of near-surface microbes across large spatial scales. We collected dust samples from the external surfaces of {$\sim$}1,200 households located across the United States to understand the continental-scale distributions of bacteria and fungi in the near-surface atmosphere. The microbial communities were highly variable in composition across the United States, but the geographic patterns could be explained by climatic and soil variables, with coastal regions of the United States sharing similar airborne microbial communities. Although people living in more urbanized areas were not found to be exposed to distinct outdoor air microbial communities compared with those living in more rural areas, our results do suggest that urbanization leads to homogenization of the airborne microbiota, with more urban communities exhibiting less continental-scale geographic variability than more rural areas. These results provide our first insight into the continental-scale distributions of airborne microbes, which is information that could be used to identify likely associations between microbial exposures in outdoor air and incidences of disease in crops, livestock, and humans.},

The symbiosis between mycorrhizal soil fungi and higher plants takes advantage of active collaboration with specific helper bacteria. Thus, a symbiosis so far thought of involving two components could be the result of the interaction among at least three different partners. This chapter focuses on the relationship between edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and soil bacteria, in particular nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with Tuber species. The ability of these bacteria to modify nutrient availability during the fructification phase is very important to truffle development. This chapter will also discuss perspectives on the beneficial use of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to develop predictive models that could be used to improve the mycorrhization processes with the further aim of obtaining plants infected with Tuber magnatum Pico, the most economically important truffle species that remains difficult to cultivate.},

  abstract = {Aim Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

Large-scale DNA barcoding provides qualitatively novel data to test for correlations across hierarchical levels (genes, genealogies and species), and may help to unveil the underlying processes. Here we analyse sequence variation in communities of aquatic beetles across Europe ({$>$}5,000 individuals) to test for self-similarity of beta diversity patterns at multiple hierarchical levels. We show that community similarity at all levels decreases exponentially with geographic distance, and initial similarity is correlated with the lineage age, consistent with a molecular clock. Log--log correlations between lineage age, number of lineages, and range sizes, reveal a fractal geometry in time and space, indicating a spatio-temporal continuum of biodiversity across scales. Simulations show that these findings mirror dispersal-constrained models of haplotype distributions. These novel macroecological patterns may be explained by neutral evolutionary processes, acting continuously over time to produce multi-scale regularities of biodiversity.},

The two main bases for estimating total fungal diversity are (1) the number of described species and their taxonomic structure, and (2) extrapolating species-area relationships. We argue that knowledge of fungal taxonomy and environmental sampling of fungi are both too incomplete for either approach to be reliable. However, it is likely that the true number of fungal species on the planet is a seven-digit number, and may even be an order of magnitude higher.},

However, there is growing evidence that microeukaryotes living on and in larger organisms (e.g. plants, animals, macroalgae) are diverse and in many cases abundant. We present here a new combination of `anti-metazoan' primers: 574*f--UNonMet\_DB that amplify a wide diversity of microeukaryotes including some groups that are difficult to amplify using other primer combinations. While many groups of microeukaryotic parasites are recognised, myriad other microeukaryotes are associated with hosts as previously unknown parasites (often genetically divergent so difficult to amplify using standard PCR primers), opportunistic parasites, commensals, and other ecto- and endo-symbionts, across the `symbiotic continuum'. These fulfil a wide range of roles from pathogenesis to mutually beneficial symbioses, but mostly their roles are unknown and likely fall somewhere along this spectrum, with the potential to switch the nature of their interactions with the host under different conditions. The composition and dynamics of host-associated microbial communities are also increasingly recognised as important moderators of host health. This `pathobiome' approach to understanding disease is beginning to supercede a one-pathogen-one-disease paradigm, which cannot sufficiently explain many disease scenarios.},

  abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and biomass has been a long standing debate in ecology. Soil biodiversity and biomass are essential drivers of ecosystem functions. However, unlike plant communities, little is known about how the diversity and biomass of soil microbial communities are interlinked across globally distributed biomes, and how variations in this relationship influence ecosystem function. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a field survey across global biomes, with contrasting vegetation and climate types. We show that soil carbon (C) content is associated to the microbial diversity--biomass relationship and ratio in soils across global biomes. This ratio provides an integrative index to identify those locations on Earth wherein diversity is much higher compared with biomass and vice versa. The soil microbial diversity-to-biomass ratio peaks in arid environments with low C content, and is very low in C-rich cold environments. Our study further advances that the reductions in soil C content associated with land use intensification and climate change could cause dramatic shifts in the microbial diversity-biomass ratio, with potential consequences for broad soil processes.},

  abstract = {A baseline survey of macroinvertebrate populations in two mine-water treatment wetlands, one treating a net acidic spoil heap discharge and one a net alkaline ferruginous pumped mine water, was undertaken to assess the potential of these systems to provide habitats for faunal communities. Both wetlands were found to be impoverished in comparison to natural wetlands but did sustain a macroinvertebrate community that could support higher organisms. Wetland size and water quality in terms of pH, conductivity and metal concentrations were found to be important factors in determining the quality of the populations supported. Direct toxicity to organisms was unlikely to be the main cause of lower diversity, but the smothering of organisms via the precipitation of iron hydroxides particularly in the early parts of the treatment systems affected macroinvertebrate communities. The presence of areas of open water within the planted systems was found to be important for providing habitats for macroinvertebrates and this should be both a future design and maintenance consideration for environmental managers.},

  abstract = {Entorrhiza is a small fungal genus comprising 14 species that all cause galls on roots of Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. Although this genus was established 130 years ago, crucial questions on the phylogenetic relationships and biology of this enigmatic taxon are still unanswered. In order to infer a robust hypothesis about the phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and to evaluate evolutionary trends, multiple gene sequences and morphological characteristics of Entorrhiza were analyzed and compared with respective findings in Fungi. In our comprehensive five-gene analyses Entorrhiza appeared as a highly supported monophyletic lineage representing the sister group to the rest of the Dikarya, a phylogenetic placement that received but moderate maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony bootstrap support. An alternative maximum likelihood tree with the constraint that Entorrhiza forms a monophyletic group with Basidiomycota could not be rejected. According to the first phylogenetic hypothesis, the teliospore tetrads of Entorrhiza represent the prototype of the dikaryan meiosporangium. The alternative hypothesis is supported by similarities in septal pore structure, cell wall and spindle pole bodies. Based on the isolated phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and its peculiar combination of features related to ultrastructure and reproduction mode, we propose a new phylum Entorrhizomycota, for the genus Entorrhiza, which represents an apparently widespread group of inconspicuous fungi.},

  abstract = {Sedimentation and alterations of natural hydroperiods from watershed cultivation have affected most depressional wetlands in the Great Plains. This can result in altered plant community structure through changes in water availability and depth as well as burial of seed banks. The vegetation and seed banks of 15 wetlands were sampled within the Rainwater Basin Region of Nebraska. Our objectives were to: (1) compare wetland seed bank communities among wetlands with different watershed land uses (reference, restored and impacted by watershed cultivation); (2) determine the available seed bank following sediment removal and establish if wetland zonation occurs in the deeper sediment layer of pre-scraped agricultural wetlands; and (3) determine the similarity between extant vegetation and the seed banks for each wetland land use treatment. There were no significant differences in seed bank species richness and the number and composition of annual, perennial, native, or exotic species among reference, restored, and agricultural playas. Restored wetlands had a greater number of upland species germinate from the surface soil seed bank compared to reference and agricultural playas. Availability of seeds after 30 cm of soil was removed (to simulate available seed bank if the wetland was to be restored) in crop land use wetlands was low (2--52 seeds/wetland) making determination of wetland zonation difficult. There was no difference in the similarity between the seed bank and extant vegetation among the three land use treatments. Sediment removal appears to be successful in removing weedy and exotic species from the seed bank; however, the seed bank is not the primary source for playa wetland revegetation. Restored and reference wetlands have similar seed bank community characteristics (i.e., richness) however, each wetland land use treatment was associated with differing plant species and plant guilds.},

  abstract = {36 fungal {$\beta$}-tubulin sequences were analysed to study the evolution of this gene and the phylogeny of basidiomycetes. The analysis comprises a representative selection of all major lineages of basidiomycetous fungi and some selected ascomycetes for comparison. Intron positions vary between the different lineages, but seem to be conserved in the Hymenomycetes and Ustilaginomycetes. The most conserved regions seem to be highly susceptible for introns. Splicing and branching sites of the introns are more variable in basidiomycetes than reported from other fungal groups so far.Basidiomycete monophyly was confirmed with our data in respect to the ascomycetes studied. By analysing amino acid sequences, the Hymenomycetes and the Ustilaginomycetes were resolved as monophyletic groups. The phylogeny within these two groups is similar to that obtained with other genes. Based on {$\beta$}-tubulin data Naohidea sebacea, Chionosphaera apobasidialis, Jaculispora submersa, Platygloea pustulata, Platygloea disciformis and Melampsora lini, representing the Urediniomycetes, are not resolved in most analyses.

A low diversity was found for Tonga, and island biogeography theory is used to discuss these results. Sampling effort is evaluated through rarefaction curves.

  abstract = {During the last 15 years the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear DNA has been used as a target for analyzing fungal diversity in environmental samples, and has recently been selected as the standard marker for fungal DNA barcoding. In this study we explored the potential amplification biases that various commonly utilized ITS primers might introduce during amplification of different parts of the ITS region in samples containing mixed templates ('environmental barcoding'). We performed in silico PCR analyses with commonly used primer combinations using various ITS datasets obtained from public databases as templates. Some of the ITS primers, such as ITS1-F, were hampered with a high proportion of mismatches relative to the target sequences, and most of them appeared to introduce taxonomic biases during PCR. Some primers, e.g. ITS1-F, ITS1 and ITS5, were biased towards amplification of basidiomycetes, whereas others, e.g. ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4, were biased towards ascomycetes. The assumed basidiomycete-specific primer ITS4-B only amplified a minor proportion of basidiomycete ITS sequences, even under relaxed PCR conditions. Due to systematic length differences in the ITS2 region as well as the entire ITS, we found that ascomycetes will more easily amplify than basidiomycetes using these regions as targets. This bias can be avoided by using primers amplifying ITS1 only, but this would imply preferential amplification of 'non-dikarya' fungi. We conclude that ITS primers have to be selected carefully, especially when used for high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples. We suggest that different primer combinations or different parts of the ITS region should be analyzed in parallel, or that alternative ITS primers should be searched for.},

  abstract = {Biological soil crusts, a community of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses that live on the soil surface, occur in deserts throughout the world. They are a critical component of desert ecosystems, as they are important contributors to soil fertility and stability. Future climate scenarios predict alteration of the timing and amount of precipitation in desert environments. Because biological soil crust organisms are only metabolically active when wet, and as soil surfaces dry quickly in deserts during late spring, summer, and early fall, the amount and timing of precipitation is likely to have significant impacts on the physiological functioning of these communities. Using the three dominant soil crust types found in the western United States, we applied three levels of precipitation frequency (50\% below-average, average, and 50\% above-average) while maintaining average precipitation amount (therefore changing both timing and size of applied events). We measured the impact of these treatments on photosynthetic performance (as indicated by dark-adapted quantum yield and chlorophyll a concentrations), nitrogenase activity, and the ability of these organisms to maintain concentrations of radiation-protective pigments (scytonemin, beta-carotene, echinenone, xanthophylls, and canthaxanthin). Increased precipitation frequency produced little response after 2.5 months exposure during spring (1 April--15 June) or summer (15 June--31 August). In contrast, most of the above variables had a large, negative response after exposure to increased precipitation frequency for 6 months spring--fall (1 April--31 October) treatment. The crusts dominated by the soil lichen Collema, being dark and protruding above the surface, dried the most rapidly, followed by the dark surface cyanobacterial crusts (Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus), and then by the light cyanobacterial crusts (Microcoleus). This order reflected the magnitude of the observed response: crusts dominated by the lichen Collema showed the largest decline in quantum yield, chlorophyll a, and protective pigments; crusts dominated by Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus showed an intermediate decline in these variables; and the crusts dominated by Microcoleus showed the least negative response. Most previous studies of crust response to radiation stress have been short-term laboratory studies, where organisms were watered and kept under moderate temperatures. Such conditions would give crust organisms access to ample carbon to respond to imposed stresses (e.g., production of UV-protective pigments, replacement of degraded chlorophyll). In contrast, our longer-term study showed that under field conditions of high air temperatures and frequent, small precipitation events, crust organisms appear unable to produce protective pigments in response to radiation stress, as they likely dried more quickly than when they received larger, less frequent events. Reduced activity time likely resulted in less carbon available to produce or repair chlorophyll a and/or protective pigments. Our findings may partially explain the global observation that soil lichen cover and richness declines as the frequency of summer rainfall increases.},

Substituting one or more base(s) within or at the 3'-termi of the universal primers by inosine can overcome some of their shortcomings improving amplification capacity. Universal primer sets do not usually amplify sequences with nucleotide mismatch to the templates, particularly in the last three bases, whereas inosine-modified primers anneal and amplify a variety of rRNA gene sequences. Inosine-containing primers are therefore might be useful to detect more species in diverse prokaryotic populations. The article summarizes the pros and cons of using inosine especially at the 3' termini of universal primers in nucleic acid amplification for the study of microbial diversity.},

  abstract = {Competition--colonization tradeoff models explain the coexistence of competing species in terms of a tradeoff between competitive ability and colonization ability. One class of such models is based on the idea that seed size determines competitive ability, seed number determines colonization ability, and the two traits are negatively correlated such that higher competitive ability of large-seeded species compensates for their smaller seed number. According to such models, species inhabiting the same community should show a distinct ranking of competitive ability and this ranking should be correlated with seed size. We tested these predictions using a greenhouse competition experiment focusing on 25 annual species that coexist in sandy habitats of the Mediterranean region in Israel. Rankings of species based on their competitive effects on two independent phytometers were positively correlated. Corresponding rankings based on competitive responses were also correlated. Rankings based on competitive effects were correlated with those based on competitive responses. Yet, in spite of the clear hierarchy in all measures of competitive ability, none of the measures was correlated with seed size. While lack of correlation between seed size and competitive ability has been documented in some systems, our study is the first time that absence of such correlation is documented in a system where the existence of competition is well established and the component species show a clear hierarchy of competitive ability.},

  abstract = {The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the primary choice for molecular identification of fungi. Its two highly variable spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) are usually species specific, whereas the intercalary 5.8S gene is highly conserved. For sequence clustering and blast searches, it is often advantageous to rely on either one of the variable spacers but not the conserved 5.8S gene. To identify and extract ITS1 and ITS2 from large taxonomic and environmental data sets is, however, often difficult, and many ITS sequences are incorrectly delimited in the public sequence databases. We introduce ITSx, a Perl-based software tool to extract ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 -- as well as full-length ITS sequences -- from both Sanger and high-throughput sequencing data sets. ITSx uses hidden Markov models computed from large alignments of a total of 20 groups of eukaryotes, including fungi, metazoans and plants, and the sequence extraction is based on the predicted positions of the ribosomal genes in the sequences. ITSx has a very high proportion of true-positive extractions and a low proportion of false-positive extractions. Additionally, process parallelization permits expedient analyses of very large data sets, such as a one million sequence amplicon pyrosequencing data set. ITSx is rich in features and written to be easily incorporated into automated sequence analysis pipelines. ITSx paves the way for more sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes. The software also permits elimination of non-ITS sequences from any data set. This is particularly useful for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing data sets, where insidious non-target sequences are often found among the target sequences. Such non-target sequences are difficult to find by other means and would contribute noise to diversity estimates if left in the data set.},

Logistic regression analysis was conducted on 27 primer- and template-related characteristics, of which most could be ignored apart from those related to the GC content of the template. Overall GC content of the template was a good predictor for PCR success; however, specificity and sensitivity values for predicted outcome were improved to 84.3 and 94.8\%, respectively, when regionalized GC content was employed. This represented a significant improvement in predictability with respect to GC content alone (P \&lt; 0.001; {$\chi$}2) and is expected to increase in relative sensitivity as template size increases. Regionalized GC was calculated with respect to a threshold of 61\% GC content and a sliding window of 21 bp across the target sequence. Fine-tuning of PCR conditions is not practicable for all target sequences whenever a large number of genes of different lengths and GC content are to be amplified in parallel, particularly if total open reading frame or domain coverage is essential for recombinant protein synthesis. Thus, the present method is proposed as a means of grouping subsets of genes possessing potentially difficult target sequences so that PCR conditions can be optimized separately in order to obtain improved outcomes.},

  abstract = {Integration of fungal evolution with the dates of plate tectonic movements, paleoecology, and the evolution of plants and animals requires a molecular clock. Imperfect though they may be, molecular clocks provide the means to convert molecular change into geological time. The relationships among clocks, phylogeography, fossils, and substitution rate variation, along with incorporation of uncertainty into clock estimates are the topics for this commentary. This commentary is timely because, for deeper divergences on the order of hundreds of millions of years, estimates of age of origin are benefiting from increasingly accurate organismal phylogenies and increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution. Taking advantage of Bayesian approaches permitting complex assumptions about node ages and molecular evolution, we used the program BEAST to apply a relaxed lognormal clock analysis to a data set comprising 50 loci for 26 taxa. In the resulting tree, branches associated with nodes calibrated by fossils showed more dramatic substitution rate variation than branches at nodes lacking calibration. As a logical extension of this result, we suspect that undetected rate variation in the uncalibrated parts of the tree is as dramatic as in the calibrated sections, underscoring the importance of fossil calibration. Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa. To help evaluate which fossils might be useful for constraining the ages of nodes, we selected fossils thought to be early members of their clades and used ribosomal or protein-coding gene sequence substitution rates to calculate whether fossil age and expected lineage age coincide. Where ages of a fossil and the expected age of a lineage do coincide, the fossils will be particularly useful in constraining node ages in molecular clock analyses.},

Fungi are perhaps also the most important mutualistic symbionts in modern ecosystems, transporting poorly soluble mineral nutrients to plants and thus enhancing the growth of vegetation. However, at their origin over a billion years ago, fungi, like plants and animals, were unicellular marine microbes. Like the other multicellular kingdoms, Fungi evolved increased size, complexity, and metabolic functioning. Interactions of fungi with plants changed terrestrial ecology and geology and modified the Earth's atmosphere. In this review, we discuss the diversification and ecological roles of the fungi over their first 600 million years, from their origin through their colonization of land, drawing on phylogenomic evidence for their relationships and metabolic capabilities and on molecular dating, fossils, and modeling of Earth's paleoclimate.},

  abstract = {EukRibo is a manually curated, public reference database of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S rDNA) sequences of eukaryotes, specifically aimed at taxonomic annotation of high-throughput metabarcoding datasets. Unlike other reference databases of ribosomal genes, it is not meant to exhaustively capture all publicly available 18S rDNA sequences from the INSDC repositories, but to represent a subset of highly trustable sequences covering the whole known diversity of eukaryotes. EukRibo strives to include only sequences with verified, up-to-date taxonomic identifications, with a strong focus on protists, and relatively low genetic redundancy, to keep the database compact yet comprehensive. Environmental clone sequences representing previously identified novel diversity are accepted as reference sequences only if they have a precise lineage designation, useful for taxonomic annotation. EukRibo is part of a suite of public resources generated by the UniEuk project, which all follow a common taxonomic framework for maximal interoperability. The high level of taxonomic accuracy of EukRibo allows higher confidence in the taxonomic annotation of environmental metabarcodes, and should facilitate identification of new eukaryotic diversity at various taxonomic levels. The database is currently in version 2, and all versions are permanently stored and made available via the FAIR open platform Zenodo. It is our hope that EukRibo will help ongoing curation efforts of other 18S rDNA reference databases, and we welcome suggestions of corrections and new features to be included in subsequent versions.},

  abstract = {We focus on sparse modelling of high-dimensional covariance matrices using Bayesian latent factor models. We propose a multiplicative gamma process shrinkage prior on the factor loadings which allows introduction of infinitely many factors, with the loadings increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. We use our prior on a parameter-expanded loading matrix to avoid the order dependence typical in factor analysis models and develop an efficient Gibbs sampler that scales well as data dimensionality increases. The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors. Operating characteristics are assessed through simulation studies, and the approach is applied to predict survival times from gene expression data.},

  abstract = {Fungi play vital roles in ecosystems as endophytes, pathogens and saprobes. The current estimate of fungal diversity is highly uncertain, ranging from 1.5 to 12 million, but only around 150,000 species have been named and classified to date. Since the introduction of DNA based methods for species identification, the number of newly described taxa has increased from approximately 1000 to around 2000 yearly. This demonstrates the importance of DNA based methods to identify and distinguish species, especially cryptic species. Many novel species from recent studies have been found in historically understudied regions and habitats, but these still represent only a small percentage of the estimated species. In this paper, we examine 16 genera from the top 40 most speciose genera as listed in Species Fungorum as case studies to examine the diversity of taxa in each genus. The genera treated herein are Cercospora, Diaporthe, Meliola, Passalora, Phyllachora, Phyllosticta, Pseudocercospora, Ramularia (ascomycetes) and Cortinarius, Entoloma, Inocybe, Marasmius, Psathyrella, Puccinia, Russula, Uromyces (basidiomycetes). We critically evaluate the number of species in these genera and correlate these numbers with the number of entries in GenBank. We introduce 18 new species Apiospora multiloculata, Candolleomyces thailandensis, Cortinarius acutoproximus, Cortinarius melleoalbus, Cortinarius pacificus, Cortinarius parvoacetosus, Diaporthe guizhouensis, Entoloma pseudosubcorvinum, Inocybe meirensongia, Marasmius albulus, Marasmius obscuroaurantiacus, Meliola camporesii, Phyllachora siamensis, Phyllosticta doitungensis, Picipes yuxiensis, Pseudocercospora vignae, Puccinia maureanui and Russula inornata. We also introduce a new record of Candolleomyces cladii-marisci and Inocybe iringolkavensis. We discuss the genera Colletotrichum and Pleurotus that are speciose, but do not occur in the top 40. We hypothesize whether there might be more species in these genera and discuss why these genera have some of the largest number of species.},

  abstract = {Many non--photosynthetic vascular plants in 10 diverse families obtain all of their carbon from fungi, but in most cases the fungi and the ultimate sources of carbon are unknown. In a few cases, such plants have been shown to be epiparasitic because they obtain carbon from neighbouring green plants through shared mycorrhizal fungi. In all such cases, the epiparasitic plants have been found to specialize upon narrow lineages of ecto-- or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Here we show that a non--vascular plant, the non--photosynthetic liverwort Cryptothallus mirabilis, is epiparasitic and is specialized on Tulasnella species that form ectomycorrhizae with surrounding trees at four locations in England, France and Portugal. By using microcosm experiments we show that the interaction with Tulasnella is necessary for growth of Cryptothallus, and by using labelling experiments we show that 14CO2 provided to birch seedlings is transferred to Cryptothallus by Tulasnella. This is one of the first documented cases of epiparasitism by a non--vascular plant and of ectomycorrhizal formation by Tulasnella. These results broaden the emerging association between epiparasitism and mycorrhizal specialization into a new class of plants and a new order of fungi.},

  abstract = {GenBank, the public repository for nucleotide and protein sequences, is a critical resource for molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. While some attention has been drawn to sequence errors ([1][1]), common annotation errors also reduce the value of this database. In fact, for organisms such as fungi, which are notoriously difficult to identify, up to 20\% of DNA sequence records may have erroneous lineage designations in GenBank ([2][2]). Gene function annotation in protein sequence databases is similarly error-prone ([3][3], [4][4]). Because identity and function of new sequences are often determined by bioinformatic analyses, both types of errors are propagated into new accessions, leading to long-term degradation of the quality of the database. Currently, primary sequence data are annotated by the authors of those data, and can only be reannotated by the same authors. This is inefficient and unsustainable over the long term as authors eventually leave the field. Although it is possible to link third-party databases to GenBank records, this is a short-term solution that has little guarantee of permanence. Similarly, the current third-party annotation option in GenBank (TPA) complicates rather than solves the problem by creating an identical record with a new annotation, while leaving the original record unflagged and unlinked to the new record. Since the origin of public zoological and botanical specimen collections, an open system of cumulative annotation has evolved, whereby the original name is retained, but additional opinion is directly appended and used for filing and retrieval. This was needed as new specimens and analyses allowed for reevaluation of older specimens and the original depositors became unavailable. The time has come for the public sequence database to incorporate a community-curated, cumulative annotation process that allows third parties to improve the annotations of sequences when warranted by published peer-reviewed analyses ([5][5]). 1.  1.[↵][6] 1.

  abstract = {How do you put a name on an unknown piece of DNA? From microbes to mammals, high-throughput metabarcoding studies provide a more objective view of natural communities, overcoming many of the inherent limitations of traditional field surveys and microscopy-based observations (Deiner et al., 2017). Taxonomy assignment is one of the most critical aspects of any metabarcoding study, yet this important bioinformatics task is routinely overlooked. Biodiversity surveys and conservation efforts often depend on formal species inventories: the presence (or absence) of species, and the number of individuals reported across space and time. However, computational workflows applied in eukaryotic metabarcoding studies were originally developed for use with bacterial/archaeal data sets, where microbial researchers rely on one conserved locus (nuclear 16S rRNA) and have access to vast databases with good coverage across most prokaryotic lineages -- a situation not mirrored in most multicellular taxa. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Hleap et al. (2021) carry out an extensive benchmarking exercise focused on taxonomy assignment strategies for eukaryotic metabarcoding studies utilizing the mitochondrial Cytochrome C oxidase I marker gene (COI). They assess the performance and accuracy of software tools representing diverse methodological approaches: from ``simple'' strategies based on sequence similarity and composition, to model-based phylogenetic and probabilistic classification tools. Contrary to popular assumptions, less complex approaches (BLAST and the QIIME2 feature classifier) consistently outperformed more sophisticated mathematical algorithms and were highly accurate for assigning taxonomy at higher levels (e.g. family). Lower-level assignments at the genus and species level still pose significant challenge for most existing algorithms, and sparse eukaryotic reference databases further limit software performance. This study illuminates current best practices for metabarcoding taxonomy assignments, and underscores the need for community-driven efforts to expand taxonomic and geographic representation in reference DNA barcode databases.},

  abstract = {Summary Fungi, plants, and bacteria are the major kingdoms of life with well-developed secondary metabolism. About 500,000 secondary metabolites (also referred to as natural products) have been described to date. About 100,000 of these are derived from animals, 350,000 are from plants, and 70,000 are from microbes (1 , 2). Roughly 33,500 bioactive microbial metabolites have been described (2). Of these 33,500 microbial metabolites, about 12.5\% (4,200) are metabolites of unicellular bacteria and cyanobacteria, 41\% (13,700) are products of Actinomycete fermentations, and about 47\% (15,600) are of fungal origin (1). Furthermore, the rate of discovery of new fungal metabolites has accelerated significantly in the past two decades relative to the rate of discovery in the actinomycetes, filamentous bacteria that traditionally have been the richest source of microbial natural products (2). This complex and rich secondary metabolism is highly developed in the filamentous Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, while it is underdeveloped in the unicellular forms of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota and in the Zygomycota, Blastocladiomycota, and Chytridiomycota (Fig. 1). The diversity of fungal species, particularly in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the accompanying diversification of biosynthetic genes and gene clusters points to an almost limitless potential for metabolic variation. In fact, one can argue that much of the ecological success of the filamentous fungi in colonizing virtually all habitats on the planet is owed to their ability to deploy arrays of secondary metabolites in concert with their penetrative and absorptive life forms. This dependence of the fungi on secondary metabolites to conquer diverse habitats and sustain their existence within them is evidenced by the facts that most species make multiple types of secondary metabolites, their expression is orchestrated with the life cycle and environment, and significant portions of their genomes are devoted to encoding and regulating the production of these products.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of resupinate Homobasidiomycetes (Corticiaceae s. lat. and others) were studied using ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences from a broad sample of resupinate and nonresupinate taxa. Two datasets were analysed using parsimony, a `core' dataset of 142 species, each of which is represented by four rDNA regions (mitochondrial and nuclear large and small subunits), and a `full' dataset of 656 species, most of which were represented only by nuclear large subunit rDNA sequences. Both datasets were analysed using traditional heuristic methods with bootstrapping, and the full dataset was also analysed with the Parsimony Ratchet, using equal character weights and six-parameter weighted parsimony. Analyses of both datasets supported monophyly of the eight major clades of Homobasidiomycetes recognised by Hibbett and Thorn, as well as independent lineages corresponding to the Gloeophyllum clade, corticioid clade and Jaapia argillacea. Analyses of the full dataset resolved two additional groups, the athelioid clade and trechisporoid clade (the latter may be nested in the polyporoid clade). Thus, there are at least 12 independent clades of Homobasidiomycetes. Higher-level relationships among the major clades are not resolved with confidence. Nevertheless, the euagarics clade, bolete clade, athelioid clade and Jaapia argillacea are consistently resolved as a monophyletic group, whereas the cantharelloid clade, gomphoid-phalloid clade and hymenochaetoid clade are placed at the base of the Homobasidiomycetes, which is consistent with the preponderance of imperforate parenthesomes in those groups. Resupinate forms occur in each of the major clades of Homobasidiomycetes, some of which are composed mostly or exclusively of resupinate forms (athelioid clade, corticioid clade, trechisporoid clade, Jaapia). The largest concentrations of resupinate forms occur in the polyporoid clade, russuloid clade and hymenochaetoid clade. The cantharelloid clade also includes many resupinate forms, including some that have traditionally been regarded as heterobasidiomycetes (Sebacinaceae, Tulasnellales, Ceratobasidiales). The euagarics clade, which is by far the largest clade in the Homobasidiomycetes, has the smallest fraction of resupinate species. Results of the present study are compared with recent phylogenetic analyses, and a table summarising the phylogenetic distribution of resupinate taxa is presented, as well as notes on the ecology of resupinate forms and related Homobasidiomycetes.},

This study focused taxon sampling on resupinate forms that may be related to these groups, aimed at resolving the early branching clades in the major groups of Agaricomycetidae. A specific goal was to resolve with confidence sister group relationships among Agaricales, Boletales and Atheliales, a difficult task based on conflicting results concerning the placement of the Atheliales. To this end we developed a six-locus nuclear dataset (nuc-ssu, nuc-lsu, 5.8S, rpb1, rpb2 and tef1) for 191 species, which was analyzed with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our analyses of these data corroborated the view that the Boletales are closely related to athelioid forms. We also identified an additional early branching clade within the Agaricomycetidae that is composed primarily of resupinate forms, as well as a few morphologically more elaborate forms including Plicaturopsis and Podoserpula. This clade, which we describe here as the new order Amylocorticiales, is the sister group of the Agaricales. We introduce a second order, the Jaapiales, for the lone resupinate genus Jaapia consisting of two species only. The Jaapiales is supported as the sister group of the remainder of the Agaricomycetidae, suggesting that the greatest radiation of pileate-stipitate mushrooms resulted from the elaboration of resupinate ancestors.},

Therefore, microbiota data have a hierarchical structure where samples are nested under one or several variables representing host-specific factors, often spanning multiple levels of biological organization. Current statistical methods do not accommodate this hierarchical data structure and therefore cannot explicitly account for the effect of the host in structuring the microbiota. We introduce a novel extension of joint species distribution models (JSDMs) which can straightforwardly accommodate and discern between effects such as host phylogeny and traits, recorded covariates such as diet and collection site, among other ecological processes. Our proposed methodology includes powerful yet familiar outputs seen in community ecology overall, including (a) model-based ordination to visualize and quantify the main patterns in the data; (b) variance partitioning to assess how influential the included host-specific factors are in structuring the microbiota; and (c) co-occurrence networks to visualize microbe-to-microbe associations.},

  abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) is a common method to summarize a larger set of correlated variables into a smaller and more easily interpretable axes of variation.. However, the different components needs to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represents random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and thus needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are therefore needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore,, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from non-distinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size, but not the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's, and use a real world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests. PCA can be very useful but great care is needed to avoid spurious results. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

  abstract = {The formation of chimeric sequences can create significant methodological bias in PCR-based DNA metabarcoding analyses. During mixed-template amplification of barcoding regions, chimera formation is frequent and well documented. However, profiling of fungal communities typically uses the more variable rDNA region ITS. Due to a larger research community, tools for chimera detection have been developed mainly for the 16S/18S markers. However, these tools are widely applied to the ITS region without verification of their performance. We examined the rate of chimera formation during amplification and 454 sequencing of the ITS2 region from fungal mock communities of different complexities. We evaluated the chimera detecting ability of two common chimera-checking algorithms: perseus and uchime. Large proportions of the chimeras reported were false positives. No false negatives were found in the data set. Verified chimeras accounted for only 0.2\% of the total ITS2 reads, which is considerably less than what is typically reported in 16S and 18S metabarcoding analyses. Verified chimeric `parent sequences' had significantly higher per cent identity to one another than to random members of the mock communities. Community complexity increased the rate of chimera formation. GC content was higher around the verified chimeric break points, potentially facilitating chimera formation through base pair mismatching in the neighbouring regions of high similarity in the chimeric region. We conclude that the hypervariable nature of the ITS region seems to buffer the rate of chimera formation in comparison with other, less variable barcoding regions, due to shorter regions of high sequence similarity.},

Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial filtering technique that offers as much flexibility as the Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process influencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Que{\textasciiacute} bec.},

How are we to disentangle the confounding effects of reticulate population genetic processes? Using the DNA barcode data from meiofaunal surveys, here we discuss the benefits of treating the taxa defined by barcodes without reference to their correspondence to `species', and suggest that using this non-idealist approach facilitates access to taxon groups that are not accessible to other methods of enumeration and classification. Major issues remain, in particular the methodologies for taxon discrimination in DNA barcode data.},

  abstract = {Summary Decomposer fungi, by their very nature, continually deplete the organic resources in which they grow and feed. They therefore rely on continual successful spread to new resources. In terrestrial ecosystems resources are distributed heterogeneously in space and time (1 , 2). They are often discrete, ranging in size from small fragments, e.g., bud scales, to large tree trunks, though discrete leaves en masse can form a continuous layer on the forest floor. The processes of arrival and spread are thus crucial to the success of saprotrophic fungi. Following arrival at a resource, their competitive ability determines whether they are successful in colonization and how long they retain that territory. Colonization and competition are the main focus of this paper and are discussed separately below, largely drawing on wood decay fungi for illustrative examples.},

  abstract = {Fungal peroxidases (ClassII) have a key role in degrading recalcitrant polyphenolic compounds in boreal forest wood, litter and humus. To date, their occurrence and activity have mainly been studied in a small number of white-rot wood decomposers. However, peroxidase activity is commonly measured in boreal forest humus and mineral soils, in which ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Here, we used degenerate PCR primers to investigate whether peroxidase-encoding genes are present in the genomes of a wide phylogenetic range of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi from several different genera possess peroxidase genes. The new sequences represent four major homobasidiomycete lineages, but the majority is derived from Cortinarius, Russula and Lactarius. These genera are ecologically important, but consist mainly of non-culturable species from which little ecophysiological information is available. The amplified sequences contain conserved active sites, both for folding and substrate oxidation. In some Cortinarius spp., there is evidence for gene duplications during the evolution of the genus. ClassII peroxidases seem to be an ancient and a common feature of most homobasidiomycetes, including ectomycorrhizal fungi. Production of extracellular peroxidases may provide ectomycorrhizal fungi with access to nitrogen sequestered in complex polyphenolic sources.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding of DNA extracted from environmental or bulk specimen samples is increasingly used to profile biota in basic and applied biodiversity research because of its targeted nature that allows sequencing of genetic markers from many samples in parallel. To achieve this, PCR amplification is carried out with primers designed to target a taxonomically informative marker within a taxonomic group, and sample-specific nucleotide identifiers are added to the amplicons prior to sequencing. The latter enables assignment of the sequences back to the samples they originated from. Nucleotide identifiers can be added during the metabarcoding PCR and during ``library preparation'', that is, when amplicons are prepared for sequencing. Different strategies to achieve this labelling exist. All have advantages, challenges and limitations, some of which can lead to misleading results, and in the worst case compromise the fidelity of the metabarcoding data. Given the range of questions addressed using metabarcoding, ensuring that data generation is robust and fit for the chosen purpose is critically important for practitioners seeking to employ metabarcoding for biodiversity assessments. Here, we present an overview of the three main workflows for sample-specific labelling and library preparation in metabarcoding studies on Illumina sequencing platforms; one-step PCR, two-step PCR, and tagged PCR. Further, we distill the key considerations for researchers seeking to select an appropriate metabarcoding strategy for their specific study. Ultimately, by gaining insights into the consequences of different metabarcoding workflows, we hope to further consolidate the power of metabarcoding as a tool to assess biodiversity across a range of applications.},

  abstract = {Savannah regions are predicted to undergo changes in precipitation patterns according to current climate change projections. This change will affect leaf phenology, which controls net primary productivity. It is of importance to study this since savannahs play an important role in the global carbon cycle due to their areal coverage and can have an effect on the food security in regions that depend on subsistence farming. In this study we investigate how soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, and day length control savannah phenology by developing a lagged time series model. The model uses climate data for 15 flux tower sites across four continents, and normalized difference vegetation index from satellite to optimize a statistical phenological model. We show that all three variables can be used to estimate savannah phenology on a global scale. However, it was not possible to create a simplified savannah model that works equally well for all sites on the global scale without inclusion of more site specific parameters. The simplified model showed no bias towards tree cover or between continents and resulted in a cross-validated r2 of 0.6 and root mean squared error of 0.1. We therefore expect similar average results when applying the model to other savannah areas and further expect that it could be used to estimate the productivity of savannah regions.},

Thus, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing of complex microbial communities has become possible. The sequenced 16S rRNA fragments (reads) are clustered into operational taxonomic units and taxonomic categories are assigned. Recent reports suggest that data pre-processing should be performed before clustering. We assessed combinations of data pre-processing steps and clustering algorithms on cluster accuracy for oral microbial sequence data.Results: The number of clusters varied up to two orders of magnitude depending on pre-processing. Pre-processing using both denoising and chimera checking resulted in a number of clusters that was closest to the number of species in the mock dataset (25 versus 15). Based on run time, purity and normalized mutual information, we could not identify a single best clustering algorithm. The differences in clustering accuracy among the algorithms after the same pre-processing were minor compared with the differences in accuracy among different pre-processing steps.Supplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Contact: ~bonder.m.j@gmail.com or b.brandt@acta.nl},

Parameters for the clustering procedure tend not to be justified but are set by tradition rather than being based on explicit knowledge. In this study, we explore the extent to which ordination results are affected by variation in parameter settings for the clustering procedure. Amplicon sequence data from nine microbial community studies, representing different sampling designs, spatial scales and ecosystems, were subjected to clustering into OTUs at seven different similarity thresholds (clustering thresholds) ranging from 87\% to 99\% sequence similarity. The 63 data sets thus obtained were subjected to parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations. The resulting community structures were highly similar across all clustering thresholds. We explain this pattern by the existence of strong ecological structuring gradients and phylogenetically diverse sets of abundant OTUs that are highly stable across clustering thresholds. Removing low-abundance, rare OTUs had negligible effects on community patterns. Our results indicate that microbial data sets with a clear gradient structure are highly robust to choice of sequence clustering threshold.},

  abstract = {Most plant diversity---function studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have focused on plant productivity and nutrient uptake/retention, with a notable lack of attention paid to belowground processes (e.g., root dynamics, decomposition, trace gas fluxes). Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we assessed how the richness of emergent macrophyte functional groups influences aboveground and belowground plant growth and microbial-mediated functions related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, with an emphasis on methane (CH{$_4$}) efflux and potential denitrification rates. We found that an increase in the richness of wetland plant functional groups enhanced belowground plant biomass, altered rooting patterns, and decreased methane efflux, while having no effect on aboveground plant production or denitrification potential. We hypothesize that the greater root production and increased rooting depth in the highest diversity treatments enhanced CH{$_4$} oxidation to a relatively greater degree than methane production, leading to an overall decrease in CH{$_4$} efflux across our plant functional group richness gradient.},

  abstract = {Podospora anserina is a model ascomycete that has been used for over a century to study many biological phenomena including ageing, prions and sexual reproduction. Here, through the molecular and phenotypic analyses of several strains, we delimit species that are hidden behind the P. anserina/P. pauciseta and P. comata denomination in culture collections. Molecular analyses of several regions of the genome as well as growth characteristics show that these strains form a species complex with at least seven members. None of the traditional morphology-based characters such as ascospore and perithecium sizes or presence of setae at the neck are able to differentiate all the species, unlike the ITS barcode, mycelium growth characteristics and repartition of perithecia on the thallus. Interspecific crosses are nearly sterile and most F1 progeny is female sterile. As a result of our analyses, the taxonomy of the P. anserina complex is clarified by lecto- and epitypifications of the names P. anserina, P. pauciseta and P. comata, as well as descriptions of the new species P. bellae-mahoneyi, P. pseudoanserina, P. pseudocomata, and P. pseudopauciseta. We also report on the ability of species from this complex to form a Cladorrhinum-like asexual morph and to produce tiny sclerotium-like structures.},

  abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

  abstract = {Elaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

We illustrate this process for wetland plant species based upon a matrix of 27 traits and 43 species from across eastern North America. The 43 species were selected to represent the widest range of life history types possible as well as both common species and nationally rare or endangered species. We found three main functional groups: ruderals, matrix and interstitial species, which we subdivide into a total of seven guilds. The growing number of such studies in the literature suggest that this may be an expedient measure for conservation biology and a promising one for predictions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. A ``universal non-metazoan'' polymerase chain reaction (UNonMet-PCR) that selectively amplifies a segment of non-metazoan Small Subunit (SSU) rDNA gene was validated. The primers used were: 18S-EUK581-F (5{$\prime$}-GTGCCAGCAGCCGCG-3{$\prime$}) and 18S-EUK1134-R (5{$\prime$}-TTTAAGTTTCAGCCTTGCG-3{$\prime$}) with specificity provided by the 19-base reverse primer. Its target site is highly conserved across the Archaea, Bacteria, and eukaryotes (including fungi), but not most Metazoa (except Porifera, Ctenophora, and Myxozoa) which have mismatches at bases 14 and 19 resulting in poor or failed amplification. During validation, UNonMet-PCR amplified SSU rDNA gene fragments from all assayed protists (n = 16 from 7 higher taxa, including two species of marine phytoplank-ton) and Fungi (n = 3) but amplified very poorly or not at all most assayed Metazoa (n = 13 from 8 higher taxa). When a non-metazoan parasite was present in a metazoan host, the parasite DNA was preferentially amplified. For example, DNA from the parasite Trypanosoma danilewskyi was preferentially amplified in mixtures containing up to 1,000{\texttimes} more goldfish Carassius auratus (host) DNA. Also, the weak amplification of uninfected host (Chionoecetes tanneri) SSU rDNA did not occur in the presence of a natural infection with a parasite (Hematodinium sp.). Only Hematodinium sp. SSU rDNA was amplified in samples from infected C. tanneri. This UNonMet-PCR is a powerful tool for amplifying SSU rDNA from non-metazoan pathogens or symbionts that have not been isolated from metazoan hosts.},

  abstract = {In nanopore sequencing, electrical signal is measured as DNA molecules pass through the sequencing pores. Translating these signals into DNA bases (base calling) is a highly non-trivial task, and its quality has a large impact on the sequencing accuracy. The most successful nanopore base callers to date use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accomplish the task. Convolutional layers in CNNs are typically composed of filters with constant window size, performing best in analysis of signals with uniform speed. However, the speed of nanopore sequencing varies greatly both within reads and between sequencing runs. Here, we present dynamic pooling, a novel neural network component, which addresses this problem by adaptively adjusting the pooling ratio. To demonstrate the usefulness of dynamic pooling, we developed two base callers: Heron and Osprey. Heron improves the accuracy beyond the experimental high-accuracy base caller Bonito developed by Oxford Nanopore. Osprey is a fast base caller that can compete in accuracy with Guppy high-accuracy mode, but does not require GPU acceleration and achieves a near real-time speed on common desktop CPUs.

The method is illustrated using ecological data on the abundances of species in sites and where the species are characterized by traits and sites by environmental variables. The trait data and environment data form the external constraints and the question is which traits and environmental variables are associated, how these associations drive species abundances and how they can be displayed in biplots.

Little is currently known about the drivers of fungal population differentiation and subsequent divergence of species, particularly in symbiotic, mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we investigate the population structure and environmental adaptation in Suillus brevipes (Peck) Kuntze, a wind-dispersed soil fungus that is symbiotic with pine trees. We assembled and annotated the reference genome for Su. brevipes and resequenced the whole genomes of 28 individuals from coastal and montane sites in California. We detected two clearly delineated coast and mountain populations with very low divergence. Genomic divergence was restricted to few regions, including a region of extreme divergence containing a gene encoding for a membrane Na+/H+ exchanger known for enhancing salt tolerance in plants and yeast. Our results are consistent with a very recent split between the montane and coastal Su. brevipes populations, with few small genomic regions under positive selection and a pattern of dispersal and/or establishment limitation. Furthermore, we identify a putatively adaptive gene that motivates further functional analyses to link genotypes and phenotypes and shed light on the genetic basis of adaptive traits.},

  abstract = {A phylogeny of the fungal phylum Basidiomycota is presented based on a survey of 160 taxa and five nuclear genes. Two genes, rpb2, and tef1, are presented in detail. The rpb2 gene is more variable than tef1 and recovers well-supported clades at shallow and deep taxonomic levels. The tef1 gene recovers some deep and ordinal-level relationships but with greater branch support from nucleotides compared to amino acids. Intron placement is dynamic in tef1, often lineage-specific, and diagnostic for many clades. Introns are fewer in rpb2 and tend to be highly conserved by position. When both protein-coding loci are combined with sequences of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, 18 inclusive clades of Basidiomycota are strongly supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities and 16 by parsimony bootstrapping. These numbers are greater than produced by single genes and combined ribosomal RNA gene regions. Combination of nrDNA with amino acid sequences, or exons with third codon positions removed, produces strong measures of support, particularly for deep internodes of Basidiomycota, which have been difficult to resolve with confidence using nrDNA data alone. This study produces strong boostrap support and significant posterior probabilities for the first time for the following monophyletic groups: (1) Ustilaginomycetes plus Hymenomycetes, (2) an inclusive cluster of hymenochaetoid, corticioid, polyporoid, Thelephorales, russuloid, athelioid, Boletales, and euagarics clades, (3) Thelephorales plus the polyporoid clade, (4) the polyporoid clade, and (5) the cantharelloid clade. Strong support is also recovered for the basal position of the Dacrymycetales in the Hymenomycetidae and paraphyly of the Exobasidiomycetidae.},

With sequencing costs decreasing, multiple-marker metabarcoding, spanning several branches of the tree of life, is becoming more accessible. However, bioinformatic approaches need to adjust to the diversity of taxonomic compartments targeted as well as to each barcode gene specificities. We built and tested a pipeline based on Illumina read correction with DADA2 allowing analyzing metabarcoding data from prokaryotic (16S) and eukaryotic (18S, COI) life compartments. We implemented the option to cluster Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with swarm v2, a network-based clustering algorithm, and to further curate the ASVs/OTUs based on sequence similarity and co-occurrence rates using a recently developed algorithm, LULU. Finally, flexible taxonomic assignment was implemented via Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Bayesian classifier and BLAST. We validate this pipeline with ribosomal and mitochondrial markers using eukaryotic mock communities and 42 deep-sea sediment samples. The results show that ASVs, reflecting genetic diversity, may not be appropriate for alpha diversity estimation of organisms fitting the biological species concept. The results underline the advantages of clustering and LULU-curation for producing more reliable metazoan biodiversity inventories, and show that LULU is an effective tool for filtering metazoan molecular clusters, although the minimum identity threshold applied to co-occurring OTUs has to be increased for 18S. The comparison of BLAST and the RDP Classifier underlined the potential of the latter to deliver very good assignments, but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to build comprehensive, ecosystem-specific, databases adapted to the studied communities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Environmental DNA metabarcoding is a powerful tool for studying biodiversity. However, bioinformatic approaches need to adjust to the diversity of taxonomic compartments targeted as well as to each barcode gene specificities. We built and tested a pipeline based on read correction with DADA2 allowing analysing metabarcoding data from prokaryotic (16S) and eukaryotic (18S, COI) life compartments. We implemented the option to cluster amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with swarm, a network-based clustering algorithm, and the option to curate ASVs/OTUs using LULU. Finally, taxonomic assignment was implemented via the Ribosomal Database Project Bayesian classifier (RDP) and BLAST. We validated this pipeline with ribosomal and mitochondrial markers using metazoan mock communities and 42 deep-sea sediment samples. The results show that ASVs and OTUs describe different levels of biotic diversity, the choice of which depends on the research questions. They underline the advantages and complementarity of clustering and LULU-curation for producing metazoan biodiversity inventories at a level approaching the one obtained using morphological criteria. While clustering removes intraspecific variation, LULU effectively removes spurious clusters, originating from errors or intragenomic variability. Swarm clustering affected alpha and beta diversity differently depending on genetic marker. Specifically, d-values {$>$} 1 appeared to be less appropriate with 18S for metazoans. Similarly, increasing LULU's minimum ratio level proved essential to avoid losing species in sample-poor data sets. Comparing BLAST and RDP underlined that accurate assignments of deep-sea species can be obtained with RDP, but highlighted the need for a concerted effort to build comprehensive, ecosystem-specific databases.},

A total of 24250 wetland plants and 14,000 trees and shrubs were planted on the 2 sites at a total cost of \$17,068. Sixty species of birds representing 23 families and 18 feeding guilds, including 7 species of special concern in Pennsylvania, were observed using these wetlands during the first 2 years. Broods of wood ducks (Aix sponsa), Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and mallards (Anas platy-rhynchos) were observed on both mine sites. In addition, 17 species of mammals and 8 and 7 species of amphibians and reptiles, respectively, were observed using these wetlands. Based on these results, functional wetlands may be established on mined lands without added cost to the mine operator and their construction should be given prime consideration by the mine industry and regulatory agencies}

  abstract = {The ribosomal DNA's of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus mulleri differ in their nucleotide sequences. Their base compositions are 67 and 65\% G + C, respectively. The nucleotide sequences which code for 28 s and 18 s ribosomal RNA in the rDNA of the two species could not be distinguished by their size, base composition, or fidelity of hybridization. The difference between the two ribosomal DNA's lies in their spacer regions. Complementary RNA transcribed from spacer regions hybridized to heterologous rDNA at less than 20\% of the level with which it hybridized to homologous rDNA. Partly denatured molecules of the two rDNA's were further compared by ``denaturation mapping'' in the electron microscope. The repeat length in X. mulleri rDNA is about the same as that in X. laevis rDNA. While the regions presumed to code for the 40 s precursor of rRNA have very similar denaturation patterns in the ribosomal DNA of X. laevis and X. mulleri, the patterns in the spacer regions are very different. Both physico-chemical and electron microscopic analyses show that the repeating sequences in X. mulleri ribosomal DNA are very similar, if not identical, to each other with respect to size and nucleotide sequence, a fact previously demonstrated for the rDNA of X. laevis. The multiple spacer sequences interspersed between the 18 s and 28 s gene regions have evolved together; the 18 s and 28 s genes have remained unchanged. Although the spacer regions differ greatly between species, they are very similar if not identical within each species. We conclude that a ``correction'' mechanism must operate to spread a mutation in one spacer sequence to the neighboring spacers faster than new changes arise in these genes. This phenomenon, which occurs within a single organism, is referred to as ``horizontal'' evolution, in contrast to ``vertical'' evolution which is the spread of a mutation through a breeding population.},

Recent estimates suggest the probable existence of as many as 3 million fungal species (1), and the circa 75,000 of these that have been characterized to date display a wide range of lifestyles. Many fungi occupy specific niches within natural environments, playing essential roles in nutrient scavenging and recycling. Some thrive in close harmony with species from other kingdoms, a superb example being the mycorrhizal fungi, which display mutualistic interactions with plants. Other fungi are pathogenic, causing devastating infections of plants or animals. Indeed, the global threats that fungi pose to human health and food security are being increasingly recognized (2). Fortunately, a relatively small number of fungal species cause infections in humans (circa 400 species are described in the Atlas of Clinical Fungi [3]). Some of these fungi normally occupy environmental niches but are capable of colonizing and damaging human (or animal) tissues, whereas other fungi appear to be obligately associated with their host.},

The intricate three-dimensional structures assumed by RNAs dictate their specific functions and molecular interactions. However, the limited number of mapped structures, partly due to experimental constraints of methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), highlights the importance of in silico prediction solutions. This is particularly crucial in potential applications in therapeutic drug discovery. In this context, machine learning (ML) methods have emerged as prominent candidates, having previously demonstrated prowess in solving complex challenges across various domains. This review focuses on analyzing the development of ML-based solutions for RNA structure prediction, specifically oriented toward recent advancements in the deep learning (DL) domain. A systematic analysis of 33 works reveals insights into the representation of RNA structures, secondary structure motifs, and tertiary interactions. The review highlights current trends in ML methods used for RNA structure prediction, demonstrates the growing research involvement in this field, and summarizes the most valuable findings.},

  abstract = {{$\bullet$} Soil fungi play a major role in ecological and biogeochemical processes in forests. Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). {$\bullet$} Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1). No less than 166 350 ITS reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. {$\bullet$} Most operational taxonomic units (81\%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The ITS-1 sequences (73\%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. {$\bullet$} This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Disentangling biotic and abiotic drivers of wild mushroom fruiting is fraught with difficulties because mycelial growth is hidden belowground, symbiotic and saprotrophic supply strategies may interact, and myco-ecological observations are often either discontinuous or too short. Here, we compiled and analyzed 115 417 weekly fungal fruit body counts from permanent Swiss inventories between 1975 and 2006. Mushroom fruiting exhibited an average autumnal delay of 12 days after 1991 compared with before, the annual number of fruit bodies increased from 1801 to 5414 and the mean species richness doubled from 10 to 20. Intra- and interannual coherency of symbiotic and saprotrophic mushroom fruiting, together with little agreement between mycorrhizal yield and tree growth suggests direct climate controls on fruit body formation of both nutritional modes. Our results contradict a previously reported declining of mushroom harvests and propose rethinking the conceptual role of symbiotic pathways in fungi-host interaction. Moreover, this conceptual advancement may foster new cross-disciplinary research avenues, and stimulate questions about possible amplifications of the global carbon cycle, as enhanced fungal production in moist mid-latitude forests rises carbon cycling and thus increases greenhouse gas exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Unravelling how species communities change along environmental gradients requires a dual understanding: the direct responses of the species to their abiotic surroundings and the indirect variation of these responses through biotic interactions. Here, we focus on the interactive relationships between plants and their symbiotic root-associated fungi (RAF) along stressful abiotic gradients. We investigate whether variations in RAF community composition along altitudinal gradients influence plant growth at high altitudes, where both plants and fungi face harsher abiotic conditions. We established a translocation experiment between pairs of Bistorta vivipara populations across altitudinal gradients. To separate the impact of shifting fungal communities from the overall influence of changing abiotic conditions, we used a root barrier to prevent new colonization by RAF following translocation. To characterize the RAF communities, we applied DNA barcoding to the root samples. Through the utilization of joint species distribution modelling, we assessed the relationship between changes in plant functional traits resulting from experimental treatments and the corresponding changes in the RAF communities. Our findings indicate that RAF communities influence plant responses to stressful abiotic conditions. Plants translocated from low to high altitudes grew more when they were able to associate with the resident high-altitude RAF compared to those plants that were not allowed to associate with the resident RAF. We conclude that interactions with RAF impact how plants respond to stressful abiotic conditions. Our results provide experimental support that interactions with RAF improve plant stress tolerance to altitudinal stressors such as colder temperatures and less nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {BackgroundResolving the phylogenetic relationships between eukaryotes is an ongoing challenge of evolutionary biology. In recent years, the accumulation of molecular data led to a new evolutionary understanding, in which all eukaryotic diversity has been classified into five or six supergroups. Yet, the composition of these large assemblages and their relationships remain controversial.Methodology/Principle FindingsHere, we report the sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for two species belonging to the supergroup Rhizaria and present the analysis of a unique dataset combining 29908 amino acid positions and an extensive taxa sampling made of 49 mainly unicellular species representative of all supergroups. Our results show a very robust relationship between Rhizaria and two main clades of the supergroup chromalveolates: stramenopiles and alveolates. We confirm the existence of consistent affinities between assemblages that were thought to belong to different supergroups of eukaryotes, thus not sharing a close evolutionary history.ConclusionsThis well supported phylogeny has important consequences for our understanding of the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. In particular, it questions a single red algal origin of the chlorophyll-c containing plastids among the chromalveolates. We propose the abbreviated name `SAR' (Stramenopiles+Alveolates+Rhizaria) to accommodate this new super assemblage of eukaryotes, which comprises the largest diversity of unicellular eukaryotes.},

While protists have been studied for over a century, it is the high-throughput sequencing of molecular markers from environmental samples --- the approach of metabarcoding --- that has revealed just how diverse, and abundant, these small organisms are. Metabarcoding is now routine to survey environmental diversity, so data have rapidly accumulated from a multitude of environments and at different sampling scales. This mass of data has provided unprecedented opportunities to study the taxonomic and functional diversity of protists, and how this diversity is organised in space and time. Here, we use metabarcoding as a common thread to discuss the state of knowledge in protist diversity research, from technical considerations of the approach to important insights gained on diversity patterns and the processes that might have structured this diversity. In addition to these insights, we conclude that metabarcoding is on the verge of an exciting added dimension thanks to the maturation of high-throughput long-read sequencing, so that a robust eco-evolutionary framework of protist diversity is within reach.},

Six subgenera are recognized and the recognition of subgenus Afrocantharellus as a separate genus is not accepted. The taxonomic value of individual morphological features is discussed as challenged by this new multigene phylogeny which comprises five new sections, one new subgenus and many emendations for previously recognized infrageneric groups. The paper discusses the observed discrepancy in biodiversity of Cantharellus when comparing between studies that focus either on below- or above-ground presence. A preliminary biogeographic hypothesis suggests an `out of Africa' Gondwanan origin as a result of vicariance and subsequent migrations.},

The small, reddish pink to orange C. corallinus sp. nov. is yet another look-alike of C. cinnabarinus, while the new C. flavolateritius is proposed as a new southern relative of C. lateritius. Both new species are, however, genetically clearly divergent. Such a scenario of ``cryptic species'' corresponds to a concept that is widely admitted even by field mycologists and therefore easily accepted. In contrast, typical forms of the here newly described C. velutinus sp. nov. are nearly indistinguishable from C. lateritius, but the phenotypic variability of this new species (as supported by phylogenetic inference of the TEF-1 gene) is so impressive that it is hard to accept that the various observed phenotypic forms all belong to a single species as indeed suggested by their identical sequence data. The latter scenario, that of lumping easily separable phenotypic forms in the field under a single species epitheton encounters much more criticism from most field mycologists and is only reluctantly accepted.},

  abstract = {For the very first time, morpho-anatomical features of both fruiting bodies as well as below-ground structures have been confronted with a newly produced multigene phylogeny of root symbiotic basidiomycetes using one of the most speciose genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Russula, Russulales) as an example. In this first of two papers, the authors focus more specifically on below-ground structures. Our five-gene phylogeny divides the genus in five main clades, here interpreted as representing seven subgenera, all significantly supported. Although more conserved than features of fruiting bodies, the anatomy of ectomycorrhiza does not allow for an unambiguous characterization of the main clades resolved by phylogenetic analysis, but the anatomy of ectomycorrhiza performs better to naturally classify the species of this genus. Features of fruiting bodies remain much more adequate for the delimitation of terminal clades and are irreplaceable for morphological species identification. Tropical taxa mostly nest in ancient lineages, but are also present in some terminal clades of otherwise temperate species groups. The shift from plectenchymatic to pseudoparenchymatic ECM outer mantle structures happened most likely already in the paleotropics, and is here hypothesized to have facilitated a major diversification of the genus with new hosts in the northern hemisphere. Available data as well as our own observations on below ground structures of several Lactifluus species suggests that this genus shares with Russula the absence of lactifers in ECM mantles and rhizomorphs, contrary to species of Lactarius where lactifers are always present. First observations on rhizomorphs of species in Multifurca confirm the presence of vessel-like and ladder-like hyphae, also found in the other agarioid genera of this family, while distinct lactifers are only present in the lactarioid, but not in russuloid members of this genus.},

Microbial crusts are important for nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization and water infiltration, but their role in ecosystem production is not well understood. This study addresses the following questions: what are the CO2 exchange responses of crusts to pulses of water, does the contribution of crusts to ecosystem flux differ from the soil respiratory flux, and is this contribution pulse size dependent? Following water application to crusts and soils, CO2 exchange was measured and respiration was partitioned through mixing model analysis of Keeling plots across treatments. Following small precipitation pulse sizes, crusts contributed 80\% of soil-level CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere. However, following a large pulse event, roots and soil microbes contributed nearly 100\% of the soil-level flux. Rainfall events in southern Arizona are dominated by small pulse sizes, suggesting that crusts may frequently contribute to ecosystem production. Carbon cycle studies of arid land systems should consider crusts as important contributors because of their dynamic responses to different pulse sizes as compared to the remaining ecosystem components.},

Hierarchical clustering is one of the most widely employed approaches to finding operational taxonomic units, the basis for many downstream analyses. Most existing algorithms have quadratic space and computational complexities, and thus can be used only for small or medium-scale problems. We propose a new online learning-based algorithm that simultaneously addresses the space and computational issues of prior work. The basic idea is to partition a sequence space into a set of subspaces using a partition tree constructed using a pseudometric, then recursively refine a clustering structure in these subspaces. The technique relies on new methods for fast closest-pair searching and efficient dynamic insertion and deletion of tree nodes. To avoid exhaustive computation of pairwise distances between clusters, we represent each cluster of sequences as a probabilistic sequence, and define a set of operations to align these probabilistic sequences and compute genetic distances between them. We present analyses of space and computational complexity, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new algorithm using a human gut microbiota data set with over one million sequences. The new algorithm exhibits a quasilinear time and space complexity comparable to greedy heuristic clustering algorithms, while achieving a similar accuracy to the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

  abstract = {Background: Lethal amanitas (Amanita section Phalloideae) are a group of wild, fatal mushrooms causing many poisoning cases worldwide. However, the diversity and evolutionary history of these lethal mushrooms remain poorly known due to the limited sampling and insufficient gene fragments employed for phylogenetic analyses. In this study, five gene loci (nrLSU, ITS, rpb2, ef1-{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}-tubulin) with a widely geographic sampling from East and South Asia, Europe, North and Central America, South Africa and Australia were analysed with maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Biochemical analyses were also conducted with intention to detect amatoxins and phalloidin in 14 representative samples. Result: Lethal amanitas were robustly supported to be a monophyletic group after excluding five species that were provisionally defined as lethal amanitas based on morphological studies. In lethal amanitas, 28 phylogenetic species were recognised by integrating molecular phylogenetic analyses with morphological studies, and 14 of them represented putatively new species. The biochemical analyses indicated a single origin of cyclic peptide toxins (amatoxins and phalloidin) within Amanita and suggested that this kind of toxins seemed to be a synapomorphy of lethal amanitas. Molecular dating through BEAST and biogeographic analyses with LAGRANGE and RASP indicated that lethal amanitas most likely originated in the Palaeotropics with the present crown group dated around 64.92 Mya in the early Paleocene, and the East Asia--eastern North America or Eurasia--North America--Central America disjunct distribution patterns were primarily established during the middle Oligocene to Miocene. Conclusion: The cryptic diversity found in this study indicates that the species diversity of lethal amanitas is strongly underestimated under the current taxonomy. The intercontinental sister species or sister groups relationships among East Asia and eastern North America or Eurasia--North America--Central America within lethal amanitas are best explained by the diversification model of Palaeotropical origin, dispersal via the Bering Land Bridge, followed by regional vicariance speciation resulting from climate change during the middle Oligocene to the present. These findings indicate the importance of both dispersal and vicariance in shaping the intercontinental distributions of these ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs---including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction---and of de novo OTUs---including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

New sequencing technologies produce long reads that can span the entire 16S rRNA gene, but have substantially higher error rates that have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution and a near-zero error rate. In two artificial mixtures of known bacterial strains our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members, without residual errors. The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. E. coli strains in the mock communities were correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades from the 16S gene sequences recovered by our method. In human fecal samples, our method recovered the full complement of 16S rRNA gene variants in detected E. coli strains and showed strong technical replication. We discuss the promises and challenges of of classification based on the full complement of multi-copy marker genes such as the 16S rRNA gene. There are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.},

While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences sequencing platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or lower data output. Results: In this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on the intramolecular-ligated nanopore consensus sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the INC-Seq protocol that reduces sample processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain accurate full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. Conclusions: NanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average consensus sequence accuracy of 99.5\% for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware base calling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

This method uses only unlabelled oligos and PCR master mix in two thermal cycling steps for amplification of targeted SNP loci. During this process, sequencing adapters and dual barcode sequence tags are incorporated into the amplicons enabling thousands of individuals to be pooled into a single sequencing library. Post sequencing, reads from individual samples are split into individual files using their unique combination of barcode sequences. Genotyping is performed with a simple perl script which counts amplicon-specific sequences for each allele, and allele ratios are used to determine the genotypes. We demonstrate this technique by genotyping 2068 individual steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) samples with a set of 192 SNP markers in a single library sequenced in a single Illumina HiSeq lane. Genotype data were 99.9\% concordant to previously collected TaqMan(™) genotypes at the same 192 loci, but call rates were slightly lower with GT-seq (96.4\%) relative to Taqman (99.0\%). Of the 192 SNPs, 187 were genotyped in {$\geq$}90\% of the individual samples and only 3 SNPs were genotyped in {$<$}70\% of samples. This study demonstrates amplicon sequencing with GT-seq greatly reduces the cost of genotyping hundreds of targeted SNPs relative to existing methods by utilizing a simple library preparation method and massive efficiency of scale.},

Underlying these accomplishments are very large, well-organized, and processed collections of RNA sequences. This data, starting with the sequences organized into a database management system and aligned to reveal their higher-order structure, and patterns of conservation and variation for organisms that span the phylogenetic tree, has been collected and analyzed. This type of information can be fundamental for and have an influence on the study of phylogenetic relationships, RNA structure, and the melding of these two fields. RESULTS: We have prepared a large web site that disseminates our comparative sequence and structure models and data. The four major types of comparative information and systems available for the three ribosomal RNAs (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and two of the catalytic intron RNAs (group I and group II) are: (1) Current Comparative Structure Models; (2) Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information; (3) Sequence and Structure Data; and (4) Data Access Systems. CONCLUSIONS: This online RNA sequence and structure information, the result of extensive analysis, interpretation, data collection, and computer program and web development, is accessible at our Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu.

In protein superfamilies, SD can effectively distinguish evolutionary relationships both within and between protein families, producing phylogenetic trees that closely align with those based on structural information, even with sequence identity less than 20\%. SD is highly correlated with the similarity of the protein structure, and can calculate evolutionary distances for thousands of protein pairs within seconds using a single CPU, which is significantly faster than most protein structure prediction methods that demand high computational resources and long run times. The development of SD will significantly advance phylogenetics, providing researchers with a more accurate and reliable tool for exploring evolutionary relationships.},

To date, species-discriminating barcodes efficiently describe bacterial and fungal communities associated with environmental samples, whereas investigations of soil microfauna are often hampered by the lack of a marker region encompassing the taxonomic range of soil organisms. Two new PCR primer sets targeting the V4-V5 and V5-V7 variable regions of the ribosomal 18S RNA (18S rRNA) were designed to be specific for metazoans metabarcoding and capable of detecting the majority of their lineages. In silico and in~vivo assays on four soil typologies were carried out to compare the newly developed primer sets with a selection of primers targeting the homologous gene, which were previously used to assess soil metazoan biodiversity. The new primer sets, both on the basis of the in silico and in~vivo comparisons, were very selective and consistent when analysing metazoan biodiversity across the tested soil typologies. On the basis of the coverage index and taxonomic resolution, the new primers targeting the ribosomal 18S RNA outperformed the other primers, and they represent a promising tool for assessing soil metazoan biodiversity through metabarcoding approaches.},

  abstract = {Extracellular DNA from dead microorganisms can persist in soil for weeks to years1,\hspace{0pt}2,\hspace{0pt}3. Although it is implicitly assumed that the microbial DNA recovered from soil predominantly represents intact cells, it is unclear how extracellular DNA affects molecular analyses of microbial diversity. We examined a wide range of soils using viability PCR based on the photoreactive DNA-intercalating dye propidium monoazide4. We found that, on average, 40\% of both prokaryotic and fungal DNA was extracellular or from cells that were no longer intact. Extracellular DNA inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal richness by up to 55\% and caused significant misestimation of taxon relative abundances, including the relative abundances of taxa integral to key ecosystem processes. Extracellular DNA was not found in measurable amounts in all soils; it was more likely to be present in soils with low exchangeable base cation concentrations, and the effect of its removal on microbial community structure was more profound in high-pH soils. Together, these findings imply that this `relic DNA' remaining in soil after cell death can obscure treatment effects, spatiotemporal patterns and relationships between microbial taxa and environmental conditions.},

Despite these advances, the recovery and sequencing of degraded DNA remains challenging due to limitations in the manipulation of chemically damaged and highly fragmented DNA molecules. In particular, the enzymatic reactions and DNA purification steps during library preparation can result in DNA template loss and sequencing biases, affecting downstream analyses. The development of library preparation methods that circumvent these obstacles and enable higher throughput are therefore of interest to researchers working with degraded DNA.},

The mechanisms that determine the interactions between soil microorganisms, their environment and neighbouring organisms, however, are poorly understood. Due to advances in sequencing technologies, an increasing number of metagenomics studies are being conducted on samples from diverse environments including soils. This information has not only increased our awareness of the functional potential of soil microbial communities, but also constitutes powerful reference material for soil metatranscriptomics studies. Metatranscriptomics provides a snapshot of transcriptional profiles that correspond to discrete populations within a microbial community at the time of sampling. This information can indicate the potential activities of complex microbial communities and the mechanisms that regulate them. Here we summarise the technical challenges for metatranscriptomics applied to soil environments and discuss approaches for gaining biologically meaningful insight into these datasets.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have questioned the use of high-throughput sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region to derive a semi-quantitative representation of fungal community composition. However, comprehensive studies that quantify biases occurring during PCR and sequencing of ITS amplicons are still lacking. We used artificially assembled communities consisting of 10 ITS-like fragments of varying lengths and guanine-cytosine (GC) contents to evaluate and quantify biases during PCR and sequencing with Illumina MiSeq, PacBio RS II and PacBio Sequel I technologies. Fragment length variation was the main source of bias in observed community composition relative to the template, with longer fragments generally being under-represented for all sequencing platforms. This bias was three times higher for Illumina MiSeq than for PacBio RS II and Sequel I. All 10 fragments in the artificial community were recovered when sequenced with PacBio technologies, whereas the three longest fragments ({$>$} 447 bases) were lost when sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. Fragment length bias also increased linearly with increasing number of PCR cycles but could be mitigated by optimization of the PCR setup. No significant biases related to GC content were observed. Despite lower sequencing output, PacBio sequencing was better able to reflect the community composition of the template than Illumina MiSeq sequencing.},

All the recorded eubacterial (domain Bacteria) and archaebacterial (Archaea) sequences of subunits 1 and 2 of this protein complex have been used for a comprehensive evolutionary analysis. The phylogenetic trees reveal several processes of gene duplication. Some of these are ancient, having occurred in the common ancestor of Bacteria and Archaea, whereas others have occurred in specific lines of Bacteria. We show that eubacterial quinol oxidase was derived from cytochrome c oxidase in Gram-positive bacteria and that archaebacterial quinol oxidase has an independent origin. A considerable amount of evidence suggests that Proteobacteria (Purple bacteria) acquired quinol oxidase through a lateral gene transfer from Gram-positive bacteria. The prevalent hypothesis that aerobic metabolism arose several times in evolution after oxygenic photosynthesis, is not sustained by two aspects of the molecular data. First, cytochrome oxidase was present in the common ancestor of Archaea and Bacteria whereas oxygenic photosynthesis appeared in Bacteria. Second, an extant cytochrome oxidase in nitrogen-fixing bacteria shows that aerobic metabolism is possible in an environment with a very low level of oxygen, such as the root nodules of leguminous plants. Therefore, we propose that aerobic metabolism in organisms with cytochrome oxidase has a monophyletic and ancient origin, prior to the appearance of eubacterial oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.},

  abstract = {Animals and fungi independently evolved from the protozoan phylum Choanozoa, these three groups constituting a major branch of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree known as opisthokonts. Opisthokonts and the protozoan phylum Amoebozoa (amoebae plus slime moulds) were previously argued to have evolved independently from the little-studied, largely flagellate, protozoan phylum, Sulcozoa. Sulcozoa are a likely evolutionary link between opisthokonts and the more primitive excavate flagellates that have ventral feeding grooves and the most primitive known mitochondria. To extend earlier sparse evidence for the ancestral (paraphyletic) nature of Sulcozoa, we sequenced transcriptomes from six gliding flagellates (two apusomonads; three planomonads; Mantamonas). Phylogenetic analyses of 173--192 genes and 73--122 eukaryote-wide taxa show Sulcozoa as deeply paraphyletic, confirming that opisthokonts and Amoebozoa independently evolved from sulcozoans by losing their ancestral ventral groove and dorsal pellicle: Apusozoa (apusomonads plus anaerobic breviate amoebae) are robustly sisters to opisthokonts and probably paraphyletic, breviates diverging before apusomonads; Varisulca (planomonads, Mantamonas, and non-gliding flagellate Collodictyon) are sisters to opisthokonts plus Apusozoa and Amoebozoa, and possibly holophyletic; Glissodiscea (planomonads, Mantamonas) may be holophyletic, but Mantamonas sometimes groups with Collodictyon instead. Taxon and gene sampling slightly affects tree topology; for the closest branches in Sulcozoa and opisthokonts, proportionally reducing missing data eliminates conflicts between homogeneous-model maximum-likelihood trees and evolutionarily more realistic site-heterogeneous trees. Sulcozoa, opisthokonts, and Amoebozoa constitute an often-pseudopodial `podiate' clade, one of only three eukaryotic 'supergroups'. Our trees indicate that evolution of sulcozoan dorsal pellicle, ventral pseudopodia, and ciliary gliding (probably simultaneously) generated podiate eukaryotes from Malawimonas-like excavate flagellates.},

To rectify this we sequenced cDNA libraries for seven diverse Amoebozoa and conducted phylogenetic analyses for 109 eukaryotes (17--18 Amoebozoa) using 60--188 genes. We conducted Bayesian inferences with the evolutionarily most realistic site-heterogeneous CAT-GTR-{$\Gamma$} model and maximum likelihood analyses. These unequivocally establish the monophyly of Amoebozoa, showing a primary dichotomy between the previously contested subphyla Lobosa and Conosa. Lobosa, the entirely non-flagellate lobose amoebae, are robustly partitioned into the monophyletic classes Tubulinea, with predominantly tube-shaped pseudopodia, and Discosea with flattened cells and different locomotion. Within Conosa 60/70-gene trees with very little missing data show a primary dichotomy between the aerobic infraphylum Semiconosia (Mycetozoa and Variosea) and secondarily anaerobic Archamoebae. These phylogenetic features are entirely congruent with the most recent major amoebozoan classification emphasising locomotion modes, pseudopodial morphology, and ultrastructure. However, 188-gene trees where proportionally more taxa have sparser gene-representation weakly place Archamoebae as sister to Macromycetozoa instead, possibly a tree reconstruction artefact of differentially missing data.},

However early diversification of non-ciliate lobose amoebae (Lobosa) is poorly understood. To clarify it we used recently available transcriptomes to construct a 187-gene amoebozoan tree for 30 species, the most comprehensive yet. This robustly places new genus Atrichosa (formerly lumped with Trichosphaerium) within lobosan class Tubulinea, not Discosea as previously supposed. We identified an earliest diverging lobosan clade comprising marine amoebae armoured by porose scaliform cell-envelopes, here made a novel class Cutosea with two pseudopodially distinct new families. Cutosea comprise Sapocribrum, ATCC PRA-29 misidentified as `Pessonella', plus from other evidence Squamamoeba. We confirm that Acanthamoeba and ATCC 50982 misidentified as Stereomyxa ramosa are closely related. Discosea have a strongly supported major subclade comprising Thecamoebida plus Glycostylida (suborders Dactylopodina, Stygamoebina; Vannellina) phylogenetically distinct from Centramoebida. Stygamoeba is sister to Dactylopodina. Himatismenida are either sister to Centramoebida or deeper branching. Discosea usually appear holophyletic (rarely paraphyletic). Paramoeba transcriptomes include prokinetoplastid Perkinsela-like endosymbiont sequences. Cunea, misidentified as Mayorella, is closer to Paramoeba than Vexillifera within holophyletic Dactylopodina.

Cell biology contrasts ancestral eubacterial murein peptidoglycan walls and derived neomuran N-linked glycoprotein coats/walls. Misinterpreting long stems connecting clade neomura to eubacteria on ribosomal sequence trees (plus misinterpreted protein paralogue trees) obscured this historical pattern. Universal multiprotein ribosomal protein (RP) trees, more accurate than rRNA trees, are taxonomically undersampled. To reduce contradictions with genically richer eukaryote trees and improve eubacterial phylogeny, we constructed site-heterogeneous and maximum-likelihood universal three-domain, two-domain, and single-domain trees for 143 eukaryotes (branching now congruent with 187-protein trees), 60 archaebacteria, and 151 taxonomically representative eubacteria, using 51 and 26 RPs. Site-heterogeneous trees greatly improve eubacterial phylogeny and higher classification, e.g. showing gracilicute monophyly, that many `rDNA-phyla' belong in Proteobacteria, and reveal robust new phyla Synthermota and Aquithermota. Monoderm Posibacteria and Mollicutes (two separate wall losses) are both polyphyletic: multiple outer membrane losses in Endobacteria occurred separately from Actinobacteria; neither phylum is related to Chloroflexi, the most divergent prokaryotes, which originated photosynthesis (new model proposed). RP trees support an eozoan root for eukaryotes and are consistent with archaebacteria being their sisters and rooted between Filarchaeota (=Proteoarchaeota, including `Asgardia') and Euryarchaeota sensu-lato (including ultrasimplified `DPANN' whose long branches often distort trees). Two-domain trees group eukaryotes within Planctobacteria, and archaebacteria with Planctobacteria/Sphingobacteria. Integrated molecular/palaeontological evidence favours negibacterial ancestors for neomura and all life. Unique presence of key pre-neomuran characters favours Planctobacteria only as ancestral to neomura, which apparently arose by coevolutionary repercussions (explained here in detail, including RP replacement) of simultaneous outer membrane and murein loss. Planctobacterial C-1 methanotrophic enzymes are likely ancestral to archaebacterial methanogenesis and {$\beta$}-propeller-{$\alpha$}-solenoid proteins to eukaryotic vesicle coats, nuclear-pore-complexes, and intraciliary transport. Planctobacterial chaperone-independent 4/5-protofilament microtubules and MamK actin-ancestors prepared for eukaryote intracellular motility, mitosis, cytokinesis, and phagocytosis. We refute numerous wrong ideas about the universal tree.},

AIC is justified in a very general framework, and as a result, offers a crude estimator of the expected discrepancy: one which exhibits a potentially high degree of negative bias in small-sample applications (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989). AICc corrects for this bias, but is less broadly applicable than AIC since its justification depends upon the form of the candidate model (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989, 1993; Hurvich et al., 1990; Bedrick and Tsai, 1994). Although AIC and AICc share the same objective, the derivations of the criteria proceed along very different lines, making it difficult to reconcile how AICc improves upon the approximations leading to AIC. To address this issue, we present a derivation which unifies the justifications of AIC and AICc in the linear regression framework.},

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences. Harnessing phylogenetic information to understand and forecast changes in diversity and dynamics of communities is a critical step in managing and restoring the Earth's biota in a time of rapid global change.},

  abstract = {Full taxonomic characterisation of fungal communities is necessary for establishing ecological associations and early detection of pathogens and invasive species. Complex communities of fungi are regularly characterised by metabarcoding using the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and the Large-Subunit (LSU) gene of the rRNA locus, but reliance on a single short sequence fragment limits the confidence of identification. Here we link metabarcoding from the ITS2 and LSU D1-D2 regions to characterise fungal communities associated with bark beetles (Scolytinae), the likely vectors of several tree pathogens. Both markers revealed similar patterns of overall species richness and response to key variables (beetle species, forest type), but identification against the respective reference databases using various taxonomic classifiers revealed poor resolution towards lower taxonomic levels, especially the species level. Thus, Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) could not be linked via taxonomic classifiers across ITS and LSU fragments. However, using phylogenetic trees (focused on the epidemiologically important Sordariomycetes) we placed OTUs obtained with either marker relative to reference sequences of the entire rRNA cistron that includes both loci and demonstrated the largely similar phylogenetic distribution of ITS and LSU-derived OTUs. Sensitivity analysis of congruence in both markers suggested the biologically most defensible threshold values for OTU delimitation in Sordariomycetes to be 98\% for ITS2 and 99\% for LSU D1-D2. Studies of fungal communities using the canonical ITS barcode require corroboration across additional loci. Phylogenetic analysis of OTU sequences aligned to the full rRNA cistron shows higher success rate and greater accuracy of species identification compared to probabilistic taxonomic classifiers.},

  abstract = {Lateral genetic transfer (LGT) is the process by which genetic material moves between organisms (and viruses) in the biosphere. Among the many approaches developed for the inference of LGT events from DNA sequence data, methods based on the comparison of phylogenetic trees remain the gold standard for many types of problem. Identifying LGT events from sequenced genomes typically involves a series of steps in which homologous sequences are identified and aligned, phylogenetic trees are inferred, and their topologies are compared to identify unexpected or conflicting relationships. These types of approach have been used to elucidate the nature and extent of LGT and its physiological and ecological consequences throughout the Tree of Life. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to enormous increases in the number of sequenced genomes, including ultra-deep sampling of specific taxonomic groups and single cell-based sequencing of unculturable ``microbial dark matter.'' Environmental shotgun sequencing enables the study of LGT among organisms that share the same habitat.This abundance of genomic data offers new opportunities for scientific discovery, but poses two key problems. As ever more genomes are generated, the assembly and annotation of each individual genome receives less scrutiny; and with so many genomes available it is tempting to include them all in a single analysis, but thousands of genomes and millions of genes can overwhelm key algorithms in the analysis pipeline. Identifying LGT events of interest therefore depends on choosing the right dataset, and on algorithms that appropriately balance speed and accuracy given the size and composition of the chosen set of genomes.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {$>$} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

Despite their importance, the systematics of this species complex have remained elusive and little is known about their origin and biogeography. Using DNA analyses on a worldwide sample of matsutake, we present here the first comprehensive definition of natural groupings in this species complex. We infer patterns of migration and propose Eocene origins for the group in western North America by a transfer from an angiosperm-associated ancestor to an increasingly specialized conifer symbiont. From these origins, matsutake appear to have followed migratory routes parallel to those of coniferous hosts. Patterns of vicariance between eastern North America and eastern Asia are resolved and their origins are suggested to stem from migration through Beringia. Using an analysis of genetic dissimilarity and geographical distance, we reject both the possibility that migration into Europe and Asia occurred through Atlantic bridges and the connection between matsutake populations in the Mahgrebi Mountains and those from Europe. Instead, African and European matsutake appear to be the most recent ends of a westward expansion of the domain of these fungi from North America.},

  abstract = {Background The plant working group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life recommended the two-locus combination of rbcL + matK as the plant barcode, yet the combination was shown to successfully discriminate among 907 samples from 550 species at the species level with a probability of 72\%. The group admits that the two-locus barcode is far from perfect due to the low identification rate, and the search is not over. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we compared seven candidate DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, ycf5, ITS2, and ITS) from medicinal plant species. Our ranking criteria included PCR amplification efficiency, differential intra- and inter-specific divergences, and the DNA barcoding gap. Our data suggest that the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA represents the most suitable region for DNA barcoding applications. Furthermore, we tested the discrimination ability of ITS2 in more than 6600 plant samples belonging to 4800 species from 753 distinct genera and found that the rate of successful identification with the ITS2 was 92.7\% at the species level. Conclusions The ITS2 region can be potentially used as a standard DNA barcode to identify medicinal plants and their closely related species. We also propose that ITS2 can serve as a novel universal barcode for the identification of a broader range of plant taxa.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of 16S rRNA sequences through next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial community composition and structure. One common approach in using these data to explore the genetic diversity in a microbial community is to cluster the 16S rRNA sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on sequence similarities. The inferred OTUs can then be used to estimate species, diversity, composition, and richness. Although a number of methods have been developed and commonly used to cluster the sequences into OTUs, relatively little guidance is available on their relative performance and the choice of key parameters for each method. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten existing OTU inference methods. We found that the appropriate dissimilarity value for defining distinct OTUs is not only related with a specific method but also related with the sample complexity. For data sets with low complexity, all the algorithms need a higher dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs. Some methods, such as, CROP and SLP, are more robust to the specific choice of the threshold than other methods, especially for shorter reads. For high-complexity data sets, hierarchical cluster methods need a more strict dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs because the commonly used dissimilarity threshold of 3\% often leads to an under-estimation of the number of OTUs. In general, hierarchical clustering methods perform better at lower dissimilarity thresholds. Our results show that sequence abundance plays an important role in OTU inference. We conclude that care is needed to choose both a threshold for dissimilarity and abundance for OTU inference.},

MLST is rigorous, reproducible, and informative, and MLST genotyping has been shown to identify major phylogenetic clades, molecular groups, or subpopulations of a species, as well as individual strains or clones. MLST molecular types often correlate with important phenotypes. Conventional MLST involves the extraction of genomic DNA and the amplification by PCR of several conserved, unlinked gene sequences from a sample of isolates of the taxon under investigation. In some cases, as few as three loci are sufficient to yield definitive results. The amplicons are sequenced, aligned, and compared by phylogenetic methods to distinguish statistically significant differences among individuals and clades. Although MLST is simpler, faster, and less expensive than whole genome sequencing, it is more costly and time-consuming than less reliable genotyping methods (e.g. amplified fragment length polymorphisms). Here, we describe a new MLST method that uses next-generation sequencing, a multiplexing protocol, and appropriate analytical software to provide accurate, rapid, and economical MLST genotyping of 96 or more isolates in single assay. We demonstrate this methodology by genotyping isolates of the well-characterized, human pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans.},

Although studies in a few species of culturable ciliated protists have revealed the highly dynamic nature of replicative and recombination events relating the micronucleus to the macronucleus, the broader understanding of the genomic diversity of ciliated protists, as well as their phylogenetic relationships and metabolic potential, has been hampered by the inability to culture numerous other species under laboratory conditions, as well as the presence of symbiotic bacteria and microalgae which provide a challenge for current sequencing technologies.

Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in arid ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs. Better understanding of how rainfall affects the diversity, species composition, and dynamics of arid environments can contribute to solving environmental problems stemming from land use and global climate change.},

  abstract = {Although comprehensive phylogenies have proven an invaluable tool in ecology and evolution, their construction is made increasingly challenging both by the scale and structure of publically available sequences. The distinct partition between gene-rich (genomic) and species-rich (DNA barcode) data is a feature of data that has been largely overlooked, yet presents a key obstacle to scaling supermatrix analysis. I present a phyloinformatics framework for draft construction of a species-level phylogeny of insects (Class Insecta). Matrix-building requires separately optimized pipelines for nuclear transcriptomic, mitochondrial genomic, and species-rich markers, whereas tree-building requires hierarchical inference in order to capture species-breadth while retaining deep-level resolution. The phylogeny of insects contains 49,358 species, 13,865 genera, 760 families. Deep-level splits largely reflected previous findings for sections of the tree that are data rich or unambiguous, such as inter-ordinal Endopterygota and Dictyoptera, the recently evolved and relatively homogeneous Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Brachycera (Diptera), and Cucujiformia (Coleoptera). However, analysis of bias, matrix construction and gene-tree variation suggests confidence in some relationships (such as in Polyneoptera) is less than has been indicated by the matrix bootstrap method. To assess the utility of the insect tree as a tool in query profiling several tree-based taxonomic assignment methods are compared. Using test data sets with existing taxonomic annotations, a tendency is observed for greater accuracy of species-level assignments where using a fixed comprehensive tree of life in contrast to methods generating smaller de novo reference trees. Described herein is a solution to the discrepancy in the way data are fit into supermatrices. The resulting tree facilitates wider studies of insect diversification and application of advanced descriptions of diversity in community studies, among other presumed applications.},

Several lineages in insects have undergone hyper-radiations, and thus a unified picture of their evolution is ultimately required for understanding the process of diversification. In this study I further develop informatics protocols for de novo phylogenetic construction, and present the most species-comprehensive insect phylogeny to date, constructed hierarchically using c. 440 transcriptomes, 1490 mitogenomes, DNA barcodes for 69 000 species, and several additional species-rich markers. Even with this expanded transcriptome backbone, support is still insufficient for some historically problematic nodes, particularly in Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera. Low support (measured by internode certainty) was observed for the node separating Dictyoptera from its sister polyneopeterans; configuration of the Paraneoptera was not resolved; the recently proposed Hymenoptera grouping Eusymphyta received high support, while Parasitoida did not; and Orthorrhapha (Diptera) was not recovered. Sampling is uneven across the insects, and while highly sequenced lineages (e.g. Lepidoptera) boast greater information content, this accompanies computational burdens. The protocol and resulting tree represent an advance in the analytic and phylogenetic framework, for an objectively and consistently determined species-comprehensive phylogeny.},

European Tuber melanosporum soils have a balanced texture with equal proportions of clay, silt and sand, 1--70 \% limestone, exchangeable calcium levels between 0.6 \% and 1.6 \%, pH of 7.8--8.3, 3--6 ;\% organic matter, C to N ratios of 8--12, N levels of 0.01--0.03 \%, total phosphorus 0.1--0.3 \%, exchangeable potassium (K2O) of 0.01--0.03 \% and exchangeable magnesium (MgO): 0.01--0.05 \%. In Europe, truffles are cultivated by establishing well-mycorrhized plants on calcareous, well-aerated and free draining soils, with suitable climates and with appropriate management. Climate is a principal factor limiting truffle cultivation in Europe; however, to some degree, cultural practices can compensate for unfavourable climatic and soil factors. For instance, deep tilling of soils provides better aeration and results in larger truffles, while irrigation is important in summer to maintain truffle mycorrhizas established during spring. Although practices may differ depending on the truffle species, basic principles are the same. In-field inoculations with truffle spores may also enhance the establishment, while thinning and pruning appear to promote Tuber melanosporum colonisation in the truffle plantation. The adoption of these modern techniques permits truffle cultivation in soils otherwise unfavourable and in this way may increase considerably the productive area of truffle cultivation in Europe.},

  abstract = {Estimating and comparing microbial diversity are statistically challenging due to limited sampling and possible sequencing errors for low-frequency counts, producing spurious singletons. The inflated singleton count seriously affects statistical analysis and inferences about microbial diversity. Previous statistical approaches to tackle the sequencing errors generally require different parametric assumptions about the sampling model or about the functional form of frequency counts. Different parametric assumptions may lead to drastically different diversity estimates. We focus on nonparametric methods which are universally valid for all parametric assumptions and can be used to compare diversity across communities. We develop here a nonparametric estimator of the true singleton count to replace the spurious singleton count in all methods/approaches. Our estimator of the true singleton count is in terms of the frequency counts of doubletons, tripletons and quadrupletons, provided these three frequency counts are reliable. To quantify microbial alpha diversity for an individual community, we adopt the measure of Hill numbers (effective number of taxa) under a nonparametric framework. Hill numbers, parameterized by an order q that determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species, include taxa richness (q = 0), Shannon diversity (q = 1, the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (q = 2, the inverse of Simpson index). A diversity profile which depicts the Hill number as a function of order q conveys all information contained in a taxa abundance distribution. Based on the estimated singleton count and the original non-singleton frequency counts, two statistical approaches (non-asymptotic and asymptotic) are developed to compare microbial diversity for multiple communities. (1) A non-asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of estimated diversities of standardized samples with a common finite sample size or sample completeness. This approach aims to compare diversity estimates for equally-large or equally-complete samples; it is based on the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves of Hill numbers, specifically for q = 0, 1 and 2. (2) An asymptotic approach refers to the comparison of the estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. That is, this approach compares the estimated profiles for complete samples or samples whose size tends to be sufficiently large. It is based on statistical estimation of the true Hill number of any order q {$\geq$} 0. In the two approaches, replacing the spurious singleton count by our estimated count, we can greatly remove the positive biases associated with diversity estimates due to spurious singletons and also make fair comparisons across microbial communities, as illustrated in our simulation results and in applying our method to analyze sequencing data from viral metagenomes.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic placement is the problem of placing `query' sequences into an existing tree (called a `backbone tree'). One of the most accurate phylogenetic placement methods to date is the maximum likelihood-based method pplacer, using RAxML to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree and then adding the given query sequence to the edge that maximizes the probability that the resulting tree generates the query sequence. Unfortunately, this way of running pplacer fails to return valid outputs on many moderately large backbone trees and so is limited to backbone trees with at most {$\sim$}10~000 leaves. SCAMPP is a technique to enable pplacer to run on larger backbone trees, which operates by finding a small `placement subtree' specific to each query sequence, within which the query sequence are placed using pplacer. That approach matched the scalability and accuracy of APPLES-2, the previous most scalable method. Here, we explore a different aspect of pplacer's strategy: the technique used to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree. We confirm anecdotal evidence that using FastTree instead of RAxML to estimate numeric parameters on the backbone tree enables pplacer to scale to much larger backbone trees, almost (but not quite) matching the scalability of APPLES-2 and pplacer-SCAMPP. We then evaluate the combination of these two techniques---SCAMPP and the use of FastTree. We show that this combined approach, pplacer-SCAMPP-FastTree, has the same scalability as APPLES-2, improves on the scalability of pplacer-FastTree and achieves better accuracy than the comparably scalable methods.https://github.com/gillichu/PLUSplacer-taxtastic.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

  abstract = {Successful PCR starts with proper priming between an oligonucleotide primer and the template DNA. However, the inevitable risk of mismatched priming cannot be avoided in the currently used primer system, even though considerable time and effort are devoted to primer design and optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5{$\prime$}-segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3{$\prime$}-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.},

  abstract = {High-throughput molecular technologies can profile microbial communities at high resolution even in complex environments like the intestinal microbiota. Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies allow for even finer resolution. We compared phylogenetic profiling of both longer (454 Titanium) sequence reads with shorter, but more numerous, paired-end reads (Illumina). For both approaches, we targeted six tandem combinations of 16S rRNA gene variable regions, in microbial DNA extracted from a human faecal sample, in order to investigate their limitations and potentials. In silico evaluations predicted that the V3/V4 and V4/V5 regions would provide the highest classification accuracies for both technologies. However, experimental sequencing of the V3/V4 region revealed significant amplification bias compared to the other regions, emphasising the necessity for experimental validation of primer pairs. The latest developments of 454 and Illumina technologies offered higher resolution compared to their previous versions, and showed relative consistency with each other. However, the majority of the Illumina reads could not be classified down to genus level due to their shorter length and higher error rates beyond 60\,nt. Nonetheless, with improved quality and longer reads, the far greater coverage of Illumina promises unparalleled insights into highly diverse and complex environments such as the human gut.},

In this paper a theory is developed that applies current views of protein gene evolution to the ribosomal RNAs. The major topics addressed are the variability in size, gene arrangement, and processing of the rRNAs among the three primary lines of descent. Among the conclusions are that the rRNAs of eukaryotes retain some primitive features that were probably present in the rRNAs of the earliest cell (the progenote) and that the genes coding for the three major rRNA species were probably originally unlinked.},

Although the development of HTS has allowed rapid generation of massive amounts of DNA sequence data, preparing amplicons for HTS remains a rate-limiting step. For example, HTS platforms require platform-specific adapter sequences to be present at the 5{$\prime$} and 3{$\prime$} end of the DNA fragment to be sequenced. In addition, short multiplex identifier (MID) tags are typically added to allow multiple samples to be pooled in a single HTS run. Existing methods to incorporate HTS adapters and MID tags into PCR amplicons are either inefficient, requiring multiple enzymatic reactions and clean-up steps, or costly when applied to multiple samples or loci (fusion primers). We describe a method to amplify a target locus and add HTS adapters and MID tags via a linker sequence using a single PCR. We demonstrate our approach by generating reference sequence data for two mitochondrial loci (COI and 16S) for a diverse suite of insect taxa. Our approach provides a flexible, cost-effective and efficient method to prepare amplicons for HTS.},

  abstract = {Previous observations suggested that microbial communities contribute to coral health and the ecological resilience of coral reefs. However, most studies of coral microbiology focused on prokaryotes and the endosymbiotic algae Symbiodinium. In contrast, knowledge concerning diversity of other protists is still lacking, possibly due to methodological constraints. As most eukaryotic DNA in coral samples was derived from hosts, protist diversity was missed in metagenome analyses. To tackle this issue, we designed blocking primers for Scleractinia sequences amplified with two primer sets that targeted variable loops of the 18S rRNA gene (18SV1V2 and 18SV4). These blocking primers were used on environmental colonies of Pocillopora damicornis sensu lato from two regions with contrasting thermal regimes (Djibouti and New Caledonia). In addition to Symbiodinium clades A/C/D, Licnophora and unidentified coccidia genera were found in many samples. In particular, coccidian sequences formed a robust monophyletic clade with other protists identified in Agaricia, Favia, Montastraea, Mycetophyllia, Porites, and Siderastrea coral colonies. Moreover, Licnophora and coccidians had different distributions between the two geographic regions. A similar pattern was observed between Symbiodinium clades C and A/D. Although we were unable to identify factors responsible for this pattern, nor were we able to confirm that these taxa were closely associated with corals, we believe that these primer sets and the associated blocking primers offer new possibilities to describe the hidden diversity of protists within different coral species.},

  abstract = {The Earth's Critical Zone, where physical, chemical and biological systems interact, extends from the top of the canopy to the underlying bedrock. In this study, we investigated soil moisture controls on phenology and productivity of an Acacia woodland in semi-arid central Australia. Situated on an extensive sand plain with negligible runoff and drainage, the carry-over of soil moisture content ({\texttheta}) in the rhizosphere enabled the delay of phenology and productivity across seasons, until conditions were favourable for transpiration of that water to prevent overheating in the canopy. Storage of soil moisture near the surface (in the top few metres) was promoted by a siliceous hardpan. Pulsed recharge of {\texttheta} above the hardpan was rapid and depended upon precipitation amount: 150mm storm-1 resulted in saturation of {\texttheta} above the hardpan (i.e., formation of a temporary, discontinuous perched aquifer above the hardpan in unconsolidated soil) and immediate carbon uptake by the vegetation. During dry and inter-storm periods, we inferred the presence of hydraulic lift from soil storage above the hardpan to the surface due to (i) regular daily drawdown of {\texttheta} in the reservoir that accumulates above the hardpan in the absence of drainage and evapotranspiration; (ii) the dimorphic root distribution wherein most roots were found in dry soil near the surface, but with significant root just above the hardpan; and (iii) synchronisation of phenology amongst trees and grasses in the dry season. We propose that hydraulic redistribution provides a small amount of moisture that maintains functioning of the shallow roots during long periods when the surface soil layer was dry, thereby enabling Mulga to maintain physiological activity without diminishing phenological and physiological responses to precipitation when conditions were favourable to promote canopy cooling.},

Methodology and results: The study was undertaken in Pob{\`e} area located in Southeastern part of Benin (West Africa). Ethnomycological surveys were accomplished within three ethnic groups (Nago, Holli, Fon) from five (05) villages notably Ahoy{\'e}y{\'e}, Akouho, Igana, Issaba and Towe. We applied proportional sampling techniques to select 84 respondents. The semi-structured and unstructured interviews were conducted within the sampled population, using standardized ethnomycological questionnaires. Classical index such as the Reported Value Use of Gomez Beloz (RVU), Ethnobotanical Use Value (EUV) of a species for a use category, Total Ethnobotanical Use Value (TUV), Diversity Index (DI) and Pielou evenness (EI), as well as the Sorensen index (K) were used to assess the diversity, the level of knowledge, use of wild mushrooms and variability among all three ethnic groups. A total of 19 species including 12 edible ones were recorded, with Collybia sp. and Volaviella volvacea as the commonly exploited mushrooms in the study area (TUV between 2,14 and 2,40). All recorded species are used in the study area either as food, drugs or source of cash incomes. The study revealed a great variability of knowledge, expertise and of the level of exploitation among ethnic groups (K {$<$} 50\% for all three ethnic groups). However, there exists a certain consistency of local know-how among respondents of the same ethnic group (DI = 0,027 {$<$} DI max = 37/2). At the opposite, the study suggests that mycological know-how was held by a small group of men and a large group of women (EI {$<$} 0,5 : 0,0007 {$<$} 0,5 ; 0,004 {$<$} 0,5) suggesting a differential use of fungal resources by rural communities. Conclusion and application of results: This study provides key basic data for a sustainable exploitation of Wild Useful Fungi in Pob{\`e} region.Keywords: Diversity; Know-how,;uses / use value; value chain; ethnic groups; Wild fungi; Pob{\`e}; Benin},

Morphology and molecular phylogenetic analyses based on five genes (ITS, nrLSU, rpb2, tef1-{$\alpha$}, and {$\beta$}-tubulin) revealed that A. albolimbata is a distinct species. The species is characterized by its smooth, white pileus sometimes covered by a patchy volval remnant, a bulbous stipe with a white limbate volva, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, amyloid basidiospores, and abundant inflated cells in the volva. Screening for the most notorious toxins by liquid chromatography--high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed the presence of {$\alpha$}-amanitin, {$\beta$}-amanitin, and phallacidin in A. albolimbata.},

These range from well-known and conspicuous wood-decaying mushrooms, plant growth-promoting and mutualistic mycorrhizae, and crop-destroying smut and rust fungi, to yeast-like human pathogens. Lifestyle differences have consequences for the mating and breeding systems of these fungi (see ``Glossary,'' below, for definitions of specialist terms used in this article), which are reflected in the genetic evolution of mating-type determination. For over a century fungi have been recognized as having diverse breeding systems, from homothallism (i.e., universal compatibility among gametes, including among clonemates) to heterothallism (i.e., mating among haploid gametes carrying different mating-type alleles). The study of breeding systems, for example, led to the discovery of the astounding variability in mating-type alleles among mushrooms, with thousands of different mating types in some species (1), and to the realization that in many fungal pathogens the process of sexual reproduction is closely linked to infection and pathogenicity (2) (Fig. 1). The importance of basidiomycete fungi and their great research tractability, from ecology to genomics, have brought major insights into the diversification of genetic mechanisms used to achieve sexual reproduction.},

This review provides an overview of our knowledge on the effects of toxic concentrations of metals on ectomycorrhizal populations and communities.{$\bullet$} Discussion Selection and adaptations within particular ectomycorrhizal species that colonise host plants in harsh environments is discussed. Among these adaptations, we focus on the metal exclusion strategy that is discovered in metal-tolerant ecotypes of Suillus species that thrive on metalliferous soils. Metal efflux in metal-tolerant ecotypes prevents metal overloading of cytoplasm and vacuole. At the same time, this metal-specific efflux system in Suillus seems to reduce the transfer of large quantities of metals towards the plant--fungus interface, without hampering normal nutrient transfer to the host plant.{$\bullet$} Conclusion The evolutionary adaptation in Suillus species contributes to the survival of host trees on metalliferous soils and might be exploited in phytostabilisation strategies for heavy metal-contaminated soils.},

  abstract = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large space is opened up is a consequence of the following mechanisms. "Opportunist" species with broad dispersal powers and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the presence of adults of their own or other species. Several alternative mechanisms may then determine which species replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded them. At present there exists little evidence in support of this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all species resist invasions of competitors. The first occupants preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus releasing resources. Only then can later colonists reach maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of this model. In the majority of natural communities succession is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches a stage in which further change is on a small scale as individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that offspring of the same species are much less favored than those of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep changing, producing local instability. Whether the average species composition of the whole tract does not change, exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has not yet been decided for any natural community.},

In fungi, their role in microbial pathogenesis is well established; however, these complex biomolecules also confer upon fungal microorganisms the faculty to tolerate extreme environments such as the Earth's poles, the International Space Station and places contaminated by toxic metals and ionizing radiation. A remarkable property of melanin is its capacity to interact with a wide range of electromagnetic radiation frequencies, functioning as a protecting and energy harvesting pigment. Other roles of fungal melanin include scavenging of free radical, thermo-tolerance, metal ion sequestration, cell development, and mechanical-chemical cellular strength. In this review, we explore the various functions ascribed to this biological pigment in fungi and its remarkable physicochemical properties.},

Species observations are modeled by Poisson distributions whose parameters quantify species abundances and habitat preferences, and are estimated using Bayesian computations. Our main contributions are (i) to tackle the bias induced by habitat selection behaviors, (ii) to handle data where the habitat type associated to each observation is unknown, (iii) to estimate probabilities of selection of habitat for the species.

Conclusions and future research 1086 Acknowledgements 1087 References 1087 Summary Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations were historically considered rare or absent from tropical ecosystems. Although most tropical forests are dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, ECM associations are widespread and found in all tropical regions. Here, we highlight emerging patterns of ECM biogeography, diversity and ecosystem functions, identify knowledge gaps, and offer direction for future research. At the continental and regional scales, tropical ECM systems are highly diverse and vary widely in ECM plant and fungal abundance, diversity, composition and phylogenetic affinities. We found strong regional differences among the dominant host plant families, suggesting that biogeographical factors strongly influence tropical ECM symbioses. Both ECM plants and fungi also exhibit strong turnover along altitudinal and soil fertility gradients, suggesting niche differentiation among taxa. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are often more abundant and diverse in sites with nutrient-poor soils, suggesting that ECM associations can optimize plant nutrition and may contribute to the maintenance of tropical monodominant forests. More research is needed to elucidate the diversity patterns of ECM fungi and plants in the tropics and to clarify the role of this symbiosis in nutrient and carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {Spatial records of species are commonly misidentified, which can change the predicted distribution of a species obtained from a species distribution model (SDM). Experiments were undertaken to predict the distribution of real and simulated species using MaxEnt and presence-only data ``contaminated'' with varying rates of misidentification error. Additionally, the difference between the niche of the target and contaminating species was varied. The results show that species misidentification errors may act to contract or expand the predicted distribution of a species while shifting the predicted distribution towards that of the contaminating species. Furthermore the magnitude of the effects was positively related to the ecological distance between the species' niches and the size of the error rates. Critically, the magnitude of the effects was substantial even when using small error rates, smaller than common average rates reported in the literature, which may go unnoticed while using a standard evaluation method, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the effects outlined were shown to impact negatively on practical applications that use SDMs to identify priority areas, commonly selected for various purposes such as management. The results highlight that species misidentification should not be neglected in species distribution modeling.},

  abstract = {Understanding how soil pedogenesis affects microbial communities and their in situ activities according to ecosystem functioning is a central issue in soil microbial ecology, as soils represent essential nutrient reservoirs and habitats for the biosphere. To address this question, soil chronosequences developed from a single, shared mineralogical parent material and having the same climate conditions are particularly useful, as they isolate the factor of time from other factors controlling the character of soils. In our study, we considered a natural succession of uplifted marine terraces in Mendocino, CA, ranging from highly fertile in the younger terrace (about 100,000 years old) to infertile in the older terraces (about 300,000 years old). Using ITS amplicon pyrosequencing, we analysed and compared the diversity and composition of the soil fungal communities across the first terraces (T1 to T3), with a specific focus in the forested terraces (T2 and T3) on soil samples collected below trees of the same species (Pinus muricata) and of the same age. While diversity and richness indices were highest in the grassland (youngest) terrace (T1), they were higher in the older forested terrace (T3) compared to the younger forested terrace (T2). Interestingly, the most abundant ectomycorrhizal (ECM) taxa that we found within these fungal communities showed high homology with ITS Sanger sequences obtained previously directly from ECM root tips from trees in the same study site, revealing a relative conservation of ECM diversity over time. Altogether, our results provide new information about the diversity and composition of the fungal communities as well as on the dominant ECM species in the soil chronosequence of Mendocino in relation to soil age and ecosystem development.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the different sources of evidence for the phylogenies. Well-founded and less well-founded traditional, even refuted, relationships are discussed, and if resolution appears to be lacking, this inadequacy is identified. Insects belong to arguably the most successful major lineage of the phylum Arthropoda, the joint-legged animals. The latter clade comprises myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and their relatives), chelicerates (horseshoe crabs and arachnids), crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, and relatives), and hexapods (the six-legged arthropods, Insecta, and their relatives). Lobopods (onychophorans) sometimes have been included, but now almost universally are considered to lie outside of Arthropoda. Although traditionally each major arthropod group has been considered monophyletic, most have been suspected of non-monophyly by at least a few investigators. Results of molecular analyses have provided frequent challenges, particularly in suggesting the possible paraphyly of myriapods and of crustaceans. Ideas concerning the phylogenetic relationships among the major taxa of arthropods, and the included insects, are dynamic. Although there is a single evolutionary history, efforts to uncover this phylogeny vary between different researchers, techniques, and character systems studied. No technique or character system alone can guarantee to reveal the true relationships of the studied taxa; in actuality, convergent (homoplastic) similarity that confuses relationships is common to all data. The evidence behind traditional systems, representing perhaps the thorough understanding of a single character system rather than an integration of all knowledge, sometimes cannot withstand detailed scrutiny. Molecular sequence data often appear to overturn previous ideas derived from morphological interpretation but may be misleading due to undersampling, unrecognized sampling of alternative gene duplicates (paralogs), and/or inappropriate analyses.},

Average gross primary productivity of water column producers (phytoplankton, periphyton, and submerged macrophytes), estimated from the daily shift in dissolved oxygen concentration, was generally higher in the high-flow wetlands (84 kJ m-2 d-1 in 1990; 69 kJ m-2 d-1 in 1991) than in the low-flow wetlands (73 kJ m-2 d-1 in 1990; 46 kJ m-2 d-1 in 1991). Detailed comparisons of one high-flow and one low-flow wetland at 16 sample sites in each wetland twice the solar efficiency in the high-flow wetland (0.6 vs. 0.3\%). Depth profiles indicated that the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased by as much as 60\% from 15 cm below the water's surface to 50 cm below. Chlorophyll a concentration did not correlate to productivity. Water column primary producers contributed an estimated 17 to 67\% of the net aboveground carbon production of each wetland.},

  abstract = {Botryosphaeria is a species-rich genus with a cosmopolitan distribution, commonly associated with dieback and cankers of woody plants. As many as 18 anamorph genera have been associated with Botryosphaeria, most of which have been reduced to synonymy under Diplodia (conidia mostly ovoid, pigmented, thick-walled), or Fusicoccum (conidia mostly fusoid, hyaline, thin-walled). However, there are numerous conidial anamorphs having morphological characteristics intermediate between Diplodia and Fusicoccum, and there are several records of species outside the Botryosphaeriaceae that have anamorphs apparently typical of Botryosphaeria s.str. Recent studies have also linked Botryosphaeria to species with pigmented, septate ascospores, and Dothiorella anamorphs, or Fusicoccum anamorphs with Dichomera synanamorphs. The aim of this study was to employ DNA sequence data of the 28S rDNA to resolve apparent lineages within the Botryosphaeriaceae. From these data, 12 clades are recognised. Two of these lineages clustered outside the Botryosphaeriaceae, namely Diplodia-like anamorphs occurring on maize, which are best accommodated in Stenocarpella (Diaporthales), as well as an unresolved clade including species of Camarosporium/Microdiplodia. We recognise 10 lineages within the Botryosphaeriaceae, including an unresolved clade (Diplodia/Lasiodiplodia/Tiarosporella), Botryosphaeria s.str. (Fusicoccum anamorphs), Macrophomina, Neoscytalidium gen. nov., Dothidotthia (Dothiorella anamorphs), Neofusicoccum gen. nov. (Botryosphaeria-like teleomorphs, Dichomera-like synanamorphs), Pseudofusicoccum gen. nov., Saccharata (Fusicoccum- and Diplodia-like synanamorphs),`` Botryosphaeria'' quercuum (Diplodia-like anamorph), and Guignardia (Phyllosticta anamorphs). Separate teleomorph and anamorph names are not provided for newly introduced genera, even where both morphs are known.

  abstract = {A major obstacle to high-throughput genotyping of microhymenoptera is their small size. As species are difficult to discriminate, and because complexes may exist, the sequencing of a pool of specimens is hazardous. Thus, one should be able to sequence pangenomic markers (e.g., RADtags) from a single specimen. To date, whole genome amplification (WGA) prior to library construction is still a necessity as at most 10 ng of DNA can be obtained from single specimens (sometimes less). However, this amount of DNA is not compatible with manufacturer's requirements for commercial kits. Here we test the accuracy of the GenomiPhi kit V2 on Trichogramma wasps by comparing RAD libraries obtained from the WGA of single specimens (F0 and F1 generation, about1 ng input DNA for the WGA (0.17--2.9 ng)) and a biological amplification of genomic material (the pool of the progeny of the F1 generation). Globally, we found that 99\% of the examined loci (up to 48,189 for one of the crosses, 109 bp each) were compatible with the mode of reproduction of the studied model (haplodiploidy) and Mendelian inheritance of alleles. The remaining 1\% (0.01\% of the analysed nucleotides) could represent WGA bias or other experimental/analytical bias. This study shows that the multiple displacement amplification method on which the GenomiPhi kit relies, could also be of great help for the high-throughput genotyping of microhymenoptera used for biological control, or other organisms from which only a very small amount of DNA can be extracted, such as human disease vectors (e.g., sandflies, fleas, ticks etc.).},

There has been unprecedented progress in the operationalisation of such biomonitoring by leveraging technological advances in molecular, image-based and wider monitoring techniques, ultimately building toward automation at massive scales. Given these rapid developments, an updated roadmap is needed to signpost the future direction of biomonitoring that integrates technologies and maximises advances in network ecology. Here, we highlight recent progress, particularly through the examples of molecular techniques, image-based analyses and acoustic monitoring, and how these complementary approaches can be integrated to vastly enhance biomonitoring. We summarise recent progress in network inference and key methods that show promise for the future transition toward automation. We also discuss advances in data merging, the implications of this for network construction and analysis, and emerging best practices. This is presented within the context of capitalising on ecological networks to generate informative, meaningful and accessible metrics that can assess and guide biomonitoring. Through this roadmap, we ultimately highlight three distinct challenge areas in need of urgent progress: (1) unified methods for data collection, (2) reproducible and robust big data, and (3) accurately inferring and analysing networks. Addressing these challenges through an iterative process within a communicative knowledge network encompassing researchers, policymakers, end users and industry is crucial to ensure progress toward sustainable, effective and meaningful biomonitoring.},

  abstract = {In most metagenomic sequencing studies, the initial analysis step consists in assessing the evolutionary provenance of the sequences. Phylogenetic (or Evolutionary) Placement methods can be employed to determine the evolutionary position of sequences with respect to a given reference phylogeny. These placement methods do however face certain limitations: The manual selection of reference sequences is labor-intensive; the computational effort to infer reference phylogenies is substantially larger than for methods that rely on sequence similarity; the number of taxa in the reference phylogeny should be small enough to allow for visually inspecting the results.We present algorithms to overcome the above limitations. First, we introduce a method to automatically construct representative sequences from databases to infer reference phylogenies. Second, we present an approach for conducting large-scale phylogenetic placements on nested phylogenies. Third, we describe a preprocessing pipeline that allows for handling huge sequence datasets. Our experiments on empirical data show that our methods substantially accelerate the workflow and yield highly accurate placement results.Freely available under GPLv3 at http://github.com/lczech/gappa.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Compared to alternative (e.\,g., similarity-based) methods, it puts metabarcoding sequences into a phylogenetic context using a set of known reference sequences and taking evolutionary history into account. Thereby, one can increase the accuracy of metagenomic surveys and eliminate the requirement for having exact or close matches with existing sequence databases. Phylogenetic placement constitutes a valuable analysis tool per se, but also entails a plethora of downstream tools to interpret its results. A common use case is to analyze species communities obtained from metagenomic sequencing, for example via taxonomic assignment, diversity quantification, sample comparison, and identification of correlations with environmental variables. In this review, we provide an overview over the methods developed during the first 10~years. In particular, the goals of this review are 1) to motivate the usage of phylogenetic placement and illustrate some of its use cases, 2) to outline the full workflow, from raw sequences to publishable figures, including best practices, 3) to introduce the most common tools and methods and their capabilities, 4) to point out common placement pitfalls and misconceptions, 5) to showcase typical placement-based analyses, and how they can help to analyze, visualize, and interpret phylogenetic placement data.},

A decade ago, we had little information about intraspecific somatic mycelial interactions within species and an almost complete lack of information regarding the structure and organization of fungal populations. Since then, however, somatic mycelial interactions have been studied in more than 100 fungal species, and the results applied to studies of population structure in almost 50 species (Rayner 1991; Glass and Kuldau 1992). Nevertheless, only a few such studies concern ectomycorrhizal fungi (Fries 1987; Dahlberg and Stenlid 1990, 1994).},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A fundamental goal of ecological research is to understand and model how processes generate patterns so that if conditions change, changes in the patterns can be predicted. Different approaches have been proposed for modelling species assemblage, but their use to predict spatial patterns of species richness and other community attributes over a range of spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Different methods emphasize different processes of structuring communities and different goals. In this review, we focus on models that were developed for generating spatially explicit predictions of communities, with a particular focus on species richness, composition, relative abundance and related attributes. We first briefly describe the concepts and theories that span the different drivers of species assembly. A combination of abiotic processes and biotic mechanisms are thought to influence the community assembly process. In this review, we describe four categories of drivers: (i) historical and evolutionary, (ii) environmental, (iii) biotic, and (iv) stochastic. We discuss the different modelling approaches proposed or applied at the community level and examine them from different standpoints, i.e. the theoretical bases, the drivers included, the source data, and the expected outputs, with special emphasis on conservation needs under climate change. We also highlight the most promising novelties, possible shortcomings, and potential extensions of existing methods. Finally, we present new approaches to model and predict species assemblages by reviewing promising ?integrative frameworks? and views that seek to incorporate all drivers of community assembly into a unique modelling workflow. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these new solutions and how they may hasten progress in community-level modelling.},

Ecological data from 39 Danish sites, each with several wet heathland plots, were sampled in the period 2007--2014. Including resampling over the years, 1322 plots were sampled. Plant cover was measured using the pin-point method and the joint distribution of the key plant species in the wet heathland ecosystem, Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, and an aggregate class of other higher plants was estimated assuming a Dirichlet-multinomial mixture distribution. The investigated drivers of wet heathland vegetation include nitrogen deposition, soil type, pH, precipitation and grazing. Generally, the two dwarf shrubs, E. tetralix and C.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic organisms play essential roles in the biology and fertility of soils. For example the micro and mesofauna contribute to the fragmentation and homogenization of plant organic matter, while its hydrolysis is primarily performed by the fungi. To get a global picture of the activities carried out by soil eukaryotes we sequenced 2{\texttimes}10,000 cDNAs synthesized from polyadenylated mRNA directly extracted from soils sampled in beech (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce (Picea abies) forests. Taxonomic affiliation of both cDNAs and 18S rRNA sequences showed a dominance of sequences from fungi (up to 60\%) and metazoans while protists represented less than 12\% of the 18S rRNA sequences. Sixty percent of cDNA sequences from beech forest soil and 52\% from spruce forest soil had no homologs in the GenBank/EMBL/DDJB protein database. A Gene Ontology term was attributed to 39\% and 31.5\% of the spruce and beech soil sequences respectively. Altogether 2076 sequences were putative homologs to different enzyme classes participating to 129 KEGG pathways among which several were implicated in the utilisation of soil nutrients such as nitrogen (ammonium, amino acids, oligopeptides), sugars, phosphates and sulfate. Specific annotation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes identified enzymes active on major polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin) and glycoside hydrolases represented 0.5\% (beech soil)--0.8\% (spruce soil) of the cDNAs. Other sequences coding enzymes active on organic matter (extracellular proteases, lipases, a phytase, P450 monooxygenases) were identified, thus underlining the biotechnological potential of eukaryotic metatranscriptomes. The phylogenetic affiliation of 12 full-length carbohydrate active enzymes showed that most of them were distantly related to sequences from known fungi. For example, a putative GH45 endocellulase was closely associated to molluscan sequences, while a GH7 cellobiohydrolase was closest to crustacean sequences, thus suggesting a potentially significant contribution of non-fungal eukaryotes in the actual hydrolysis of soil organic matter.},

Although many taxonomic changes have already been implemented for teleomorph taxa, this is not yet the case for the large genus Candida and smaller anascosporic (anamorph) genera. In view of the recently introduced requirement that a fungal species or higher taxon be assigned only a single valid name under the new International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code), the current species of Candida and other anamorph yeast genera must undergo revision to make genus membership consistent with phylogenetic affinities. A review of existing data and analyses shows that certain Candida species may be assigned to teleomorph genera with high confidence using multigene phylogenies. Candida species that form well-circumscribed phylogenetic clades without any teleomorph member justify the creation of new genera. However, a considerable number of Candida species sit at the end of isolated and often long branches, and hence cannot be assigned to larger species groups. They should be maintained in Candida sensu lato until studied by multigene analyses in datasets with comprehensive taxon sampling. The principle of name stability has to be honoured to the largest extent compatible with a natural classification of Candida species.},

  abstract = {Microbial symbionts inhabit tissues of all plants and animals. Their community composition depends largely on two ecological processes: (1) filtering by abiotic conditions and host species determining the environments that symbionts are able to colonize and (2) dispersal-limitation determining the pool of symbionts available to colonize a given host and community spatial structure. In plants, the above- and belowground tissues represent such distinct habitats for symbionts that we expect different effects of filtering and spatial structuring on their symbiont communities. In this study, we characterized above- and belowground communities of fungal endophytes---fungi living asymptomatically within plants---to understand the contributions of filtering and spatial structure to endophyte community composition. We used a culture-based approach to characterize endophytes growing in leaves and roots of three species of coastal beachgrasses in dunes of the USA Pacific Northwest. For leaves, endophyte isolation frequency and OTU richness depended primarily on plant host species. In comparison, for roots, both isolation frequency and OTU richness increased from the nutrient-poor front of the dune to the higher-nutrient backdune. Endophyte community composition in leaves exhibited a distance-decay relationship across the region. In a laboratory assay, faster growth rates and lower spore production were more often associated with leaf- than root-inhabiting endophytes. Overall, our results reveal a greater importance of biotic filtering by host species and dispersal-limitation over regional geographic distances for aboveground leaf endophyte communities and stronger effects of abiotic environmental filtering and locally patchy distributions for belowground root endophyte communities.},

  abstract = {Two methods were evaluated to extract ergosterol for quantitation of fungal biomass in Marshan, Zurich, and Batavia soils. Yields of ergosterol from hyphae and from fungal-colonized soil were greater when fungal tissue was extracted with an alkaline solvent mixture than when base was added to neutral extracts following removal of solids. A lyophilization treatment prior to extraction increased yields from Marshan but not from Zurich and Batavia soils. Losses of ergosterol during lyophilization were prevented by a rapid freezing treatment before lyophilization of soil samples. Recoveries from soil fortified with pure ergosterol did not accutately model recoveries from fungal tissue in these substrates. Thus, determinations of extraction efficiencies should be based upon recoveries from fungal tissue added to soils. Ergosterol was quantitatively recovered from Marshan and Zurich soils fortified with fungal tissue; however, only ca 66\% was recovered from Batavia soil, a subsoil with a high clay content. The limit of detection of Phanerochaete chrysosporium from the three soils ranged from 8 to 15 {$\mu$}g biomass g soil-1.},

  abstract = {Cosmopolitan plant root symbionts The aboveground lives of plants are only sustainable because of the symbiotic soil fungi that encase their roots. These fungi swap nutrients with plants, defend them from attack, and help them withstand abrupt environmental changes. Out of necessity, fungal symbionts in the soil would appear to be restricted and local to certain plant species. Davison et al., however, discovered that some taxa are globally distributed. How these underground fungi have dispersed so widely remains a mystery; perhaps human farmers have had something to do with it. Science, this issue p. 970 The global biogeography of microorganisms remains largely unknown, in contrast to the well-studied diversity patterns of macroorganisms. We used arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus DNA from 1014 plant-root samples collected worldwide to determine the global distribution of these plant symbionts. We found that AM fungal communities reflected local environmental conditions and the spatial distance between sites. However, despite AM fungi apparently possessing limited dispersal ability, we found 93\% of taxa on multiple continents and 34\% on all six continents surveyed. This contrasts with the high spatial turnover of other fungal taxa and with the endemism displayed by plants at the global scale. We suggest that the biogeography of AM fungi is driven by unexpectedly efficient dispersal, probably via both abiotic and biotic vectors, including humans. The wide distribution of plant-root fungal symbionts seems to be driven by recent dispersal rather than ancient tectonics.

However, the ecological niches of individual AM fungal taxa are poorly understood. We collected {$>$} 300 soil samples from natural ecosystems worldwide and modelled the realised niches of AM fungal virtual taxa (VT; approximately species-level phylogroups). We found that environmental and spatial variables jointly explained VT distribution worldwide, with temperature and pH being the most important abiotic drivers, and spatial effects generally occurring at local to regional scales. While dispersal limitation could explain some variation in VT distribution, VT relative abundance was almost exclusively driven by environmental variables. Several environmental and spatial effects on VT distribution and relative abundance were correlated with phylogeny, indicating that closely related VT exhibit similar niche optima and widths. Major clades within the Glomeraceae exhibited distinct niche optima, Acaulosporaceae generally had niche optima in low pH and low temperature conditions, and Gigasporaceae generally had niche optima in high precipitation conditions. Identification of the realised niche space occupied by individual and phylogenetic groups of soil microbial taxa provides a basis for building detailed hypotheses about how soil communities respond to gradients and manipulation in ecosystems worldwide.},

  abstract = {Gyroporus (Sclerodermatineae, Boletales, Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota, Fungi) is a genus of ectomycorrhizal mushroom-forming fungi distributed throughout the world in suitable habitats. Previous attempts to untangle the diversity of this genus proved difficult due to the presence of semi-cryptic species and equivocal results from phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA markers. To overcome these obstacles, a combined taxonomic and phylogenetic (emphasizing protein-coding genes) approach is used here to delimit species and elucidate geographic and evolutionary patterns of Gyroporus . Careful study of relevant literature and herbarium specimens was augmented by field work in North America, Australia, and East Asia for observation and collection of fresh material. For phylogenetic analyses, the mitochondrial gene atp6 and the nuclear gene rpb2 were utilized. The nuclear gene tef1 was also utilized for select exemplars. Several distinct clades are inferred, most notably a clade corresponding to Gyroporus castaneus as a speciose northern hemisphere group (the castaneus clade), a clade unifying Gyroporus cyanescens and similar entities (the cyanescens clade), and a clade unifying Gyroporus longicystidiatus and a New World sister species (the longicystidiatus clade). Also highly notable is the recovery of a sister relationship between the cyanescens and longicystidiatus clades. Abundant sister relationships between Eurasian and North American (including Central American) Gyropori are apparent and suggestive of boreotropical biogeographic scenarios; the Australian Gyropori display various biogeographic affinities. Eighteen new Gyroporus taxa are outlined and several biogeographic hypotheses are discussed. This study provides key groundwork for future efforts on this well-known but poorly-understood group of fungi.},

  abstract = {In this updated nomenclator, the names of 646 species proposed for ophiostomatoid fungi are considered. The result is 397 accepted species in 12 genera classified in the Ophiostomatales and Microascales. The taxonomic status of each species was re-evaluated based on all published details and where available, phylogenetic inferences, and data on typification. The principle of single name nomenclature, as adopted by the 18th International Botanical Congress, Melbourne in July 2011, was applied to all genera and species. Based on these re-assessments, three genera were redefined: Graphilbum in the Ophiostomatales, and Graphium and Knoxdaviesia (= Gondwanamyces) in the Microascales. Species were reclassified as necessary, resulting in 30 new combinations and one new name. Ophiostoma s.l. now includes 134 accepted species, Ceratocystiopsis 16 species, Fragosphaeria two, Graphilbum eight, Raffaelea s.str. 13, and Leptographium s.l. (including Grosmannia) 94. A further 28 species could not be assigned to any of these six genera with certainty, and seven more species were invalidly described. In the Microascales, Ceratocystis contains 72 accepted species, Graphium nine, Knoxdaviesia nine, and Sphaeronaemella seven, while Cornuvesica and Custingophora are both monotypic. Three microascalean species of uncertain status and six invalidly published species remain. Type studies and evaluation of the literature allowed the remaining 144 species described in the classical concept of Graphium to be reconsidered. Finally, 19 species previously assigned to Ceratocystis, Ceratostomella, Leptographium, Ophiostoma, Raffaelea, Sphaeronaemella and/or Sporothrix, were excluded from both the Ophiostomatales and Microascales.},

  abstract = {Discrete random probability measures and the exchangeable random partitions they induce are key tools for addressing a variety of estimation and prediction problems in Bayesian inference. Here we focus on the family of Gibbs--type priors, a recent elegant generalization of the Dirichlet and the Pitman--Yor process priors. These random probability measures share properties that are appealing both from a theoretical and an applied point of view: (i) they admit an intuitive predictive characterization justifying their use in terms of a precise assumption on the learning mechanism; (ii) they stand out in terms of mathematical tractability; (iii) they include several interesting special cases besides the Dirichlet and the Pitman--Yor processes. The goal of our paper is to provide a systematic and unified treatment of Gibbs--type priors and highlight their implications for Bayesian nonparametric inference. We deal with their distributional properties, the resulting estimators, frequentist asymptotic validation and the construction of time--dependent versions. Applications, mainly concerning mixture models and species sampling, serve to convey the main ideas. The intuition inherent to this class of priors and the neat results they lead to make one wonder whether it actually represents the most natural generalization of the Dirichlet process.},

  abstract = {Despite their restricted surface area, small farmland ponds often have a high conservation value because they contribute significantly to regional biodiversity and contain rare or unique species. For this reason, the creation of new ponds has become a widely applied practice in many countries. Information on the effects of land use on farmland ponds is very scarce. Farmland ponds differ from larger ponds, lakes and rivers in many aspects and can therefore be expected to be affected by land use via other mechanisms operating at different spatial scales. We here present a study on 126 ponds distributed over the entire territory of Belgium (surface area: 30.500 km2). We assessed variables related to turbidity state and vegetation complexity and related them to land use variables assessed at several spatial scales ranging from the pond edge up to 32 km2 circular areas. According to redundancy analysis, trampling by cattle and percentage cover of nearby crop land were positively associated with turbid state related variables. Conversely, ponds with high coverage by forest in the immediate neighbourhood tended to be more associated with the clear water state. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a negative effect of trampling and coverage by crop land on vegetation complexity. Effects of crop lands and forest were strongest at the local scale ({$<$}200 m radius) which indicates that adverse external influences can most efficiently be mitigated at a small scale. Based on these results we suggest several recommendations for pond construction and conservation.},

  abstract = {Infrageneric relations of the genetically diverse milkcap genus Lactifluus (Russulales, Basidiomycota) are poorly known. Currently used classification systems still largely reflect the traditional, mainly morphological, characters used for infrageneric delimitations of milkcaps. Increased sampling, combined with small-scale molecular studies, show that this genus is underexplored and in need of revision. For this study, we assembled an extensive dataset of the genus Lactifluus, comprising 80 \% of all known species and 30 \% of the type collections. To unravel the infrageneric relationships within this genus, we combined a multi-gene molecular phylogeny, based on nuclear ITS, LSU, RPB2 and RPB1, with a morphological study, focussing on five important characteristics (fruit body type, presence of a secondary velum, colour reaction of the latex/context, pileipellis type and presence of true cystidia). Lactifluus comprises four supported subgenera, each containing several supported clades. With extensive sampling, ten new clades and at least 17 new species were discovered, which highlight the high diversity in this genus. The traditional infrageneric classification is only partly maintained and nomenclatural changes are proposed. Our morphological study shows that the five featured characteristics are important at different evolutionary levels, but further characteristics need to be studied to find morphological support for each clade. This study paves the way for a more detailed investigation of biogeographical history and character evolution within Lactifluus.},

  abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal (EM) canopy tree Dicymbe corymbosa (Fabaceae subfam. Caesalpinioideae) forms monodominant forests in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. Like other tropical monodominants, D. corymbosa has several life-history traits that promote conspecific clumping, in contrast to density-dependent recruitment limitations characterizing most tropical trees. Dicymbe corymbosa forests, occurring in Guyana as patches within a largely non-EM mixed-species forest matrix, are important habitats for a diverse assemblage of EM fungi. Ground-based studies have not adequately determined the regional extent of D. corymbosa forests, nor are they practical due to the rugged, remote nature of the Pakaraima Mountains. We assessed the suitability of Landsat satellite imagery for mapping regional distribution of D. corymbosa forests in Guyana's Upper Potaro River Basin. Supervised image classification was performed on images from August 1989 (Landsat-5 TM) and October 1999 (Landsat-7 ETM+). In situ forest reference data were used to quantitatively assess accuracy of output classification maps. Classification performed well in distinguishing monodominant from mixed-species forests. For both images, D. corymbosa forest class accuracy was good (1989 user's accuracy = 89.8\%, Khat= 0.74; 1999 user's accuracy = 80.7\%, Khat= 0.59). The resulting output classification maps will be useful for planning fungal surveys and ecological studies in forests of the Pakaraima region. Classification of Landsat images may be effective for identifying monodominant forests in other remote regions of the tropics.},

In the absence of protective scales, feathers, or fur, the skin has to be highly effective in defending the organism against a gamut of opportunistic fungi surrounding us. Most (sub)cutaneous infections enter the body by implantation through the skin barrier. On intact skin, two types of fungal expansion are noted: (A) colonization by commensals, i.e., growth enabled by conditions prevailing on the skin surface without degradation of tissue, and (B) infection by superficial pathogens that assimilate epidermal keratin and interact with the cellular immune system. In a response-damage framework (1), all fungi are potentially able to cause disease, as a balance between their natural predilection and the immune status of the host. For this reason we will not attribute a fixed ecological term to each species, but rather describe them as growing in a commensal state (A) or in a pathogenic state (B).},

This study was aimed to examine the effects of fire on macrofungal taxa richness, diversity and sporocarp production in the Dry Afromontane forests in Ethiopia. Sporocarps were collected from nine plots (100m2) established in one- and ten-year-old burned stands, and in an unburned stands. The data were used to quantify fungal richness and sporocarp fresh weights. Morphological and molecular analyses were used to identify the fungi. Composite soil samples were also collected from each stand and used to determine main edaphic explanatory variables for taxa composition. A total of 61 fungal taxa, belonging to Basidiomycota division were reported, of which 22 were edible. Fungal diversity, richness and sporocarp production were affected just after the fire. Fungal community composition was significantly correlated with Organic matter, P and Ca. Generally, the result is encouraging from the point of view of fungal conservation. It provides novelty information about the macrofungal communities in Ethiopian dry Afromontane forests, likely including many taxa are still unknown to science as well as several edible species which could supply complementary incomes for the rural populations in the study area.},

This subfamily displays high morphological variability and is one of the early branching clades in the evolution of legumes. Using previously published and newly generated sequences from four loci (matK-trnK, rpL16, trnG-trnG2G and ITS), we develop a new densely sampled phylogeny to assess generic relationships and tribal delimitations within Detarioideae. The ITS phylogenetic trees are poorly resolved, but the plastid data recover several strongly supported clades, which also are supported in a concatenated plastid\,+\,ITS sequence analysis. We propose a new phylogeny-based tribal classification for Detarioideae that includes six tribes: re-circumscribed Detarieae and Amherstieae, and the four new tribes Afzelieae, Barnebydendreae, Saraceae and Schotieae. An identification key and descriptions for each of the tribes are also provided.},

As a result, when host-associated microbial eukaryotes are analysed by metabarcoding, the reads tend to be dominated by host sequences. We have done an in silico validation against the SILVA 18S rRNA database of a non-metazoan primer set (primers that are biased against the metazoan 18S rRNA) that recovers only 2.6\% of all the metazoan sequences, while recovering most of the other eukaryotes (80.4\%). Among metazoans, the non-metazoan primers are predicted to amplify 74\% of Porifera sequences, 4\% of Ctenophora, and 15\% of Cnidaria, while amplifying almost no sequences within Bilateria. In vivo, these non-metazoan primers reduce significantly the animal signal from coral and human samples, and when compared against universal primers provide at worst a 2-fold decrease in the number of metazoan reads and at best a 2800-fold decrease. This easy, inexpensive, and near-universal method for the study of animal-associated microeukaryotes diversity will contribute to a better understanding of the microbiome.},

We conducted a global field survey in urban greenspaces and neighboring natural ecosystems across 56 cities from six continents, and found that urban soils are important hotspots for soil bacterial, protist and functional gene diversity, but support highly homogenized microbial communities worldwide. Urban greenspaces had a greater proportion of fast-growing bacteria, algae, amoebae, and fungal pathogens, but a lower proportion of ectomycorrhizal fungi than natural ecosystems. These urban ecosystems also showed higher proportions of genes associated with human pathogens, greenhouse gas emissions, faster nutrient cycling, and more intense abiotic stress than natural environments. City affluence, management practices, and climate were fundamental drivers of urban soil communities. Our work paves the way toward a more comprehensive global-scale perspective on urban greenspaces, which is integral to managing the health of these ecosystems and the well-being of human populations.},

  abstract = {Twenty years of standardized DNA barcoding practice have resulted in millions of sequences being produced for a handful of molecular markers in a wide range of fungi, animal and plant species. Despite some basic quality controls, reference barcoding data sets deposited in the Bar-code of Life Datasystem (BOLD) database are not immune to sequencing errors and undetected pseudogenes. Such database inaccuracies can significantly bias subsequent species delimitation and biodiversity estimation based on DNA barcoding. These potential problems are amplified in metabarcoding studies containing thousands of sequences produced using high throughput se-quencing technologies. Here, we propose a pipeline based on MACSE v2, an extended version of our codon-aware multiple sequence alignment software accounting for frameshifts and stop codons. The MACSE\_BARCODE pipeline allows the accurate alignment of hundreds of thousands of protein-coding barcode sequences. Re-analyses of published data sets confirm that MACSE v2 is able to automatically detect most sequencing errors previously identified manually. The proposed alignment strategy hence alleviates the risk of incorrect species delimitation due the incorporation of sequencing errors or undetected pseudogenes. By applying the MACSE\_BARCODE pipeline to mammal, ant, and flowering plant barcode sequences available in BOLD, we highlight several cases of database errors and provide curated reference alignments for the main protein-coding barcode genes. We anticipate our approach to be particularly useful for metabarcoding studies in which thousands of new sequences need to be compared to a reference database for subsequent taxonomic assignment. This might prove particularly helpful for diet characterization studies and large-scale biodiversity assessments through environmental DNA metabarcoding. The new MACSE\_BARCODE pipeline is distributed as Nextflow workflows that are available from the MACSE project webpage (https://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/macse/).},

  abstract = {Sequence alignment is essential for phylogenetic and molecular evolution inference, as well as in many other areas of bioinformatics and evolutionary biology. Inaccurate alignments can lead to severe biases in most downstream statistical analyses. Statistical alignment based on probabilistic models of sequence evolution addresses these issues by replacing heuristic score functions with evolutionary model-based probabilities. However, score-based aligners and fixed-alignment phylogenetic approaches are still more prevalent than methods based on evolutionary indel models, mostly due to computational convenience. Here, I present new techniques for improving the accuracy and speed of statistical evolutionary alignment. The ``cumulative indel model'' approximates realistic evolutionary indel dynamics using differential equations. ``Adaptive banding'' reduces the computational demand of most alignment algorithms without requiring prior knowledge of divergence levels or pseudo-optimal alignments. Using simulations, I show that these methods lead to fast and accurate pairwise alignment inference. Also, I show that it is possible, with these methods, to align and infer evolutionary parameters from a single long synteny block (\${\textbackslash}approx\$530 kbp) between the human and chimp genomes. The cumulative indel model and adaptive banding can therefore improve the performance of alignment and phylogenetic methods.

To examine the effects of AMD precipitates independently of aqueous effects, four substrata treatments, clean sandstone, clean limestone, AMD precipitate-coated sandstone and coated limestone, were placed in a circumneutral stream of high water quality for 4 weeks. Iron and Al were the most abundant metals on rocks with AMD precipitate, and significantly decreased after the exposure. Precipitate on the substrata did not significantly affect macroinvertebrate or periphyton density and species composition. In an additional experiment, percent survival of caged live caddisflies was significantly lower when exposed in situ for 5 days in an AMD affected stream than in a reference stream. Caddisfly whole-body concentrations of all combined metals and Fe alone were significantly higher in the AMD stream. Whole-body metal concentrations were higher in killed caddisflies than in live, indicating the importance of passive uptake. The results suggest the aqueous chemical environment of AMD had a greater affect on organisms than a coating of recent AMD precipitate on the substrata (ca. 0.5 mm thick), and treatment that improves water quality in AMD impacted streams has the potential to aid in recovery of the abiotic and biotic benthic environment.},

  abstract = {Porcini (Boletus section Boletus: Boletaceae: Boletineae: Boletales) are a conspicuous group of wild, edible mushrooms characterized by fleshy fruiting bodies with a poroid hymenophore that is ``stuffed'' with white hyphae when young. Their reported distribution is with ectomycorrhizal plants throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Little progress has been made on the systematics of this group using modern molecular phylogenetic tools because sampling has been limited primarily to European species and the genes employed were insufficient to resolve the phylogeny. We examined the evolutionary history of porcini by using a global geographic sampling of most known species, new discoveries from little explored areas, and multiple genes. We used 78 sequences from the fast-evolving nuclear internal transcribed spacers and are able to recognize 18 reciprocally monophyletic species. To address whether or not porcini form a monophyletic group, we compiled a broadly sampled dataset of 41 taxa, including other members of the Boletineae, and used separate and combined phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and the mitochondrial ATPase subunit six gene. Contrary to previous studies, our separate and combined phylogenetic analyses support the monophyly of porcini. We also report the discovery of two taxa that expand the known distribution of porcini to Australia and Thailand and have ancient phylogenetic connections to the rest of the group. A relaxed molecular clock analysis with these new taxa dates the origin of porcini to between 42 and 54 million years ago, coinciding with the initial diversification of angiosperms, during the Eocene epoch when the climate was warm and humid. These results reveal an unexpected diversity, distribution, and ancient origin of a group of commercially valuable mushrooms that may provide an economic incentive for conservation and support the hypothesis of a tropical origin of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.},

This paper announces the availability of the Warcup ITS training set and shows how it can be used with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Bayesian Classifier to rapidly and accurately identify fungi using ITS sequences. The classifications can be down to species level and use conventional literature-based mycological nomenclature and taxonomic assignments.},

Surveys of their biodiversity have hitherto been geographically restricted and have not accounted for the full range of plankton size.

We analyzed 18S ribosomal DNA sequences across the intermediate plankton-size spectrum from the smallest unicellular eukaryotes (protists, {$>$}0.8 micrometers) to small animals of a few millimeters. Eukaryotic ribosomal diversity saturated at {$\sim$}150,000 operational taxonomic units, about one-third of which could not be assigned to known eukaryotic groups. Diversity emerged at all taxonomic levels, both within the groups comprising the {$\sim$}11,200 cataloged morphospecies of eukaryotic plankton and among twice as many other deep-branching lineages of unappreciated importance in plankton ecology studies. Most eukaryotic plankton biodiversity belonged to heterotrophic protistan groups, particularly those known to be parasites or symbiotic hosts. {\copyright} 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Ectomycorrhizae were sampled within a surface area of 1600 m2, and fungal taxa were identified by sequencing the rDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer region. Thirty-nine ECM fungal taxa were determined, of which 19 multi-hosts, 9 single-hosts and 11 singletons. The multi-host fungi represented 92\% (89\% when including the singletons in the analysis) of the total abundance. Except for A. fragrans, the adults of the host species displayed significant differentiation for their fungal communities, but their seedlings harboured a similar fungal community. These findings suggest that there was a potential for the formation of common mycorrhizal networks in close vicinity. However, no significant difference was detected for the {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values between seedlings and adults of each ECM plant, and no ECM species exhibited signatures of mixotrophy. Our results revealed (i) variation in ECM fungal diversity according to the seedling versus adult development stage of trees and (ii) low host specificity of ECM fungi, and indicated that multi-host fungi are more abundant than single-host fungi in this forest stand.},

  abstract = {Phenological events, such as the timing of flowering or insect emergence, are influenced by a complex combination of climatic and non-climatic factors. Although temperature is generally considered most important, other weather events such as frosts and precipitation events can also influence many species' phenology. Non-climatic variables such as photoperiod and site-specific habitat characteristics can also have important effects on phenology. Forecasting phenological shifts due to climate change requires understanding and quantifying how these multiple factors combine to affect phenology. However, current approaches to analyzing phenological data have a limited ability for quantifying multiple drivers simultaneously. Here, we use a novel statistical approach to estimate the combined effects of multiple variables, including local weather events, on the phenology of several taxa (a tree, an insect, and a fungus). We found that thermal forcing had a significant positive effect on each species, frost events delayed the phenology of the tree and butterfly, and precipitation had a positive effect on fungal fruiting. Using data from sites across latitudinal gradients, we found that these effects are remarkably consistent across sites once latitude and other site effects are accounted for. This consistency suggests an underlying biological response to these variables that is not commonly estimated using data from field observations. This approach's flexibility will be useful for forecasting ongoing phenological responses to changes in climate variability in addition to seasonal trends.},

Current algorithms to compute the optimal, gap-affine partial order alignment do not scale well to larger graphs and sequences. While heuristic approaches exist, they do not guarantee optimal alignment and sacrifice alignment accuracy. Results We present POASTA, a new optimal algorithm for partial order alignment that exploits long stretches of matching sequence between the graph and a query. We benchmarked POASTA against the state-of-the-art on several diverse bacterial gene datasets and demonstrated an average speed-up of 4.1x and up to 9.8x, using less memory. POASTA's memory scaling characteristics enabled the construction of much larger POA graphs than previously possible, as demonstrated by megabase-length alignments of 342 Mycobacterium tuberculosis sequences. Availability and implementation POASTA is available on Github at https://github.com/broadinstitute/poasta.},

  abstract = {Different second-generation sequencing technologies may have taxon-specific biases when DNA metabarcoding prey in predator faeces. Our major objective was to examine differences in prey recovery from bat guano across two different sequencing workflows using the same faecal DNA extracts. We compared results between the Ion Torrent PGM and the Illumina MiSeq with similar library preparations and the same analysis pipeline. We focus on repeatability and provide an R Notebook in an effort towards transparency for future methodological improvements. Full documentation of each step enhances the accessibility of our analysis pipeline. We tagged DNA from insectivorous bat faecal samples, targeted the arthropod cytochrome c oxidase I minibarcode region and sequenced the product on both second-generation sequencing platforms. We developed an analysis pipeline with a high operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering threshold (i.e., {$\geq$}98.5\%) followed by copy number filtering to avoid merging rare but genetically similar prey into the same OTUs. With this workflow, we detected 297 unique prey taxa, of which 74\% were identified at the species level. Of these, 104 (35\%) prey OTUs were detected by both platforms, 176 (59\%) OTUs were detected by the Illumina MiSeq system only, and 17 (6\%) OTUs were detected using the Ion Torrent system only. Costs were similar between platforms but the Illumina MiSeq recovered six times more reads and four additional insect orders than did Ion Torrent. The considerations we outline are particularly important for long-term ecological monitoring; a more standardized approach will facilitate comparisons between studies and allow faster recognition of changes within ecological communities.},

If the sequence trace is of high enough quality, however, it will contain enough information to reconstruct the two constituent sequences with very little ambiguity. Solutions already exist using comparisons with a known reference sequence, but this is often unavailable for nonmodel organisms or novel DNA regions. I present a program which determines the sizes and positions of heterozygous indels in a DNA sequence and reconstructs the two constituent haploid sequences. No external data such as a reference sequence or other prior knowledge are required. Simulation suggests an accuracy of {$>$}99\% from a single read, with errors being eliminable by the inclusion of a second sequencing read, such as one using a reverse primer. Diploid sequences can be fully reconstructed across any number of heterozygous indels, with two overlapping sequencing reads almost always sufficient to infer the entire DNA sequence. This eliminates the need for costly and laborious cloning, and allows data to be used which would otherwise be discarded. With no more laboratory work than is needed to produce two normal sequencing reads, two aligned haploid sequences can be produced quickly and accurately and with extensive phasing information.},

  abstract = {Ergosterol and microbial biomass C were measured in 26 arable, 16 grassland and 30 forest soils. The ergosterol content ranged from 0.75 to 12.94 {$\mu$}g g-1 soil. The geometric mean ergosterol content of grassland and forest soils was around 5.5 {$\mu$}g g-1, that of the arable soils 2.14 {$\mu$}g g-1. The ergosterol was significantly correlated with biomass C in the entire group of soils, but not in the subgroups of grassland and forest soils. The geometric mean of the ergosterol: microbial biomass C ratio was 6.0 mg g-1, increasing in the order grassland (5.1), arable land (5.4) and woodland (7.2). The ergosterol:microbial biomass C ratio had a strong negative relationship with the decreasing cation exchange capacity and soil pH, indicating that the fungal part of the total microbial biomass in soils increased when the buffer capacity decreased. The average ergosterol concentration calculated from literature data was 5.1 mg g-1 fungal dry weight. Assuming that fungi contain 46\% C, the conversion factor from micrograms ergosterol to micrograms fungal biomass C is 90. For soil samples, neither saponification of the extract nor the more effective direct saponification during extraction seems to be really necessary.},

  abstract = {Direct Sanger sequencing of a diploid template containing a heterozygous insertion or deletion results in a difficult-tointerpret mixed trace formed by two allelic traces superimposed onto each other. Existing computational methods for deconvolution of such traces require knowledge of a reference sequence or the availability of both direct and reverse mixed sequences of the same template. We describe a simple yet accurate method, which uses dynamic programming optimization to predict superimposed allelic sequences solely from a string of letters representing peaks within an individual mixed trace. We used the method to decode 104 human traces (mean length 294 bp) containing heterozygous indels 5 to 30 bp with a mean of 99.1\% bases per allelic sequence reconstructed correctly and unambiguously. Simulations with artificial sequences have demonstrated that the method yields accurate reconstructions when (1) the allelic sequences forming the mixed trace are sufficiently similar, (2) the analyzed fragment is significantly longer than the indel, and (3) multiple indels, if present, are well-spaced. Because these conditions occur in most encountered DNA sequences, the method is widely applicable.

  abstract = {Summary Fungi have developed a plethora of strategies to colonize plants, and these interactions result in a broad spectrum of outcomes ranging from beneficial interactions to death of the host. With respect to plant pathogens, fungi represent probably the most diverse group of ecologically and economically relevant threats. Fungal plant pathogen species are primarily in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Among ascomycetes, plant pathogens are in various classes such as the Dothideomycetes (e.g., Cladosporium spp.), Sordariomycetes (e.g., Magnaporthe spp.), or the Leotiomycetes (e.g., Botrytis spp.). Basidiomycetes are represented by the two largest plant pathogen groups: the rusts (Pucciniomycetes) and the smuts (spread among the subphylum of Ustilaginomycotina).},

The core cell cycle machinery is highly conserved among eukaryotes.

Here we characterize and improve BetaAlign, the first deep learning aligner, which substantially deviates from conventional algorithms of alignment computation. BetaAlign draws on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and trains transformers to map a set of unaligned biological sequences to an MSA. We show that our approach is highly accurate, comparable and sometimes better than state-of-the-art alignment tools. We characterize the performance of BetaAlign and the effect of various aspects on accuracy; for example, the size of the training data, the effect of different transformer architectures, and the effect of learning on a subspace of indel-model parameters (subspace learning). We also introduce a new technique that leads to improved performance compared to our previous approach. Our findings further uncover the potential of NLP-based approaches for sequence alignment, highlighting that AI-based methodologies can substantially challenge classic tasks in phylogenomics and bioinformatics.},

We then extend the GC estimator to (i) external information, in the form of non-linear constraints on subpopulation sizes and (ii) measurement error. For the first, we propose a reparameterization of the estimating equations. As a result, the constrained MLE can be found with no additional computational efforts. For the second we generalize SIMEX procedure to multiple measurement methods. In simulation we show that (even incorrect) external information can substantially decrease the MSE. We illustrate with an application to a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) population, where mostly jouvenile males are observed. We use external information on gender ratio of whale sharks to correct for low catchability of females, and our multivariate SIMEX procedure to correct for measurement error in assessment of shark length. The resulting population size estimates are about 60\% larger than the unconstrained--uncorrected counterparts.},

Transport of 32P through rhizomorphs has been demonstrated8, but their potential to absorb and transport water is not known. We have synthesized mycorrhizal rhizomorphs in association with pine, and preliminary experiments with tritiated water (3H2O) showed that the cut distal ends could absorb water which was transported to mycorrhizal roots and to seedling needles9. We have since developed a method for feeding 3H2O to the intact terminal portions of rhizomorphs in sealed vessels with negligible disturbance to the mycelial system, and we report here that mycorrhizal rhizomorphs can absorb water and facilitate its transport over ecologically significant distances. Electron microscopy shows that the rhizomorphs are differentiated structures with large central `vessel' hyphae.},

  abstract = {In the Pacific Northwest, yellow chanterelles have long been referred to as Cantharellus cibarius, synonymous with the European yellow chanterelle. Broad scale genetic surveys of North American chanterelles with C. cibarius-like morphology have demonstrated that the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer exhibits length variability, suggesting that this common morphology masks a species complex. Recently researchers have used morphological and genetic data to identify the yellow chanterelle most frequently harvested from American Pacific Northwest forests as C. formosus, a species once thought to be rare in the region. We present three genetic data sets and one morphological data set that characterize a previously undescribed, species of yellow chanterelle from the central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Phylogenetic analyses of the nrDNA large subunit and ITS regions show that C. cascadensis sp. nov., along with two other yellow chanterelle taxa (C. cibarius var. roseocanus and European C. cibarius), are more closely related to white chanterelles (C. subalbidus) than they are to C. formosus. Data from five microsatellite loci provide evidence that C. formosus, C. subalbidus, and C. cascadensis sp. nov. do not interbreed when they co-occur spatially and temporally in Douglas fir-western hemlock forests. This demonstrates that these three sympatric chanterelles are biological species with boundaries congruent with those delineated by nrDNA phylogenetic clades. Morphological data indicate that the colour of the pileus and shape of the stipe can be used to separate fresh collections of the two yellow species now known to co-occur in Douglas fir-western hemlock forests in Oregon.},

  abstract = {abstract Despite years of study and a great deal of exposure in the scientific press, there is still sometimes confusion regarding what are the defining characteristics of a rhythmic process that makes it truly circadian. The essence of this is that the rhythm must be shown not to depend in any way on continued environmental cycles, and to have a period of about a day. So, in this way, it is obvious that in petri dish cultures grown under a light-dark cycle, a rhythmic change in orange color in Neurospora crassa, or in melanin in Aspergillus fumigatus, could not be categorized as circadian, because the change in pigmentation would be seen as the result of light induction of, respectively, carotenoid or polyketide synthesis. As humans, our pupils constrict in proportion to the amount of light to which the eye is exposed, so a daily rhythm in pupil size would not be circadian but would instead reflect a diurnal cycle in ambient light. This part of the definition identifies the rhythm as truly endogenous in nature, in this way being the overt expression of an internal circadian oscillator. Beyond this, the definition is more subtle and reflects the biology of rhythms.},

  abstract = {Summary Since ancient times, humans have used fungi as food sources (1 , 2). The edible sexual structures of basidiomycetes and ascomycetes (e.g., truffles), the so-called mushrooms, are produced mostly in wood because many fungi are tree symbionts or decayers of tree tissues. These fruiting bodies represent a rich source of proteins, with low fat content and otherwise nutritionally quite poor. In some soils, they accumulate pollution (heavy metals and radioactivity) and should only be eaten in moderate quantities. Some mushroom species are considered delicacies (e.g., truffles, boletus, morels), but cultivation attempts have been unsuccessful, with a few exceptions (e.g., Morchella rufobrunnea). Only a few saprobic species can be industrially produced, such as Agaricus bisporus (3), Lentinus edodes (shiitake), and Pleurotus ostreatus, with production having mainly taken place in Asia for thousands of years (4). Some other fungi, while not really cultured, are inoculated on trees grown in appropriate natural habitats to increase the production of fruiting bodies, such as for shiitake and oyster mushrooms, with, however, sometimes unpredictable success, as is the case for truffles (5).},

  abstract = {Suspended marine particles constitute most of the particulate organic matter pool in the oceans, thereby providing substantial substrates for heterotrophs, especially in the mesopelagic. Conversely, sinking particles are major contributors to carbon fluxes defining the strength of the biological carbon pump (BCP). This study is the first to investigate the differential influence of eukaryotic communities to suspended and sinking particles, using 18S rRNA gene sequencing on particles collected with a marine snow catcher in the mixed layer and upper mesopelagic of the Scotia Sea, Southern Ocean. In the upper mesopelagic, most eukaryotic phytoplankton sequences belonged to chain-forming diatoms in sinking particles and to prymnesiophytes in suspended particles. This suggests that diatom-enriched particles are more efficient in carbon transfer to the upper mesopelagic than those enriched in prymnesiophytes in the Scotia Sea, the latter more easily disintegrating into suspended particles. In the upper mesopelagic, copepods appeared most influential on sinking particles whereas soft-tissue metazoan sequences contributed more to suspended particles. Heterotrophic protists and fungi communities were distinct between mixed layer and upper mesopelagic, implying that few protists ride along sinking particles. Furthermore, differences between predatory flagellates and radiolarians between suspended and sinking particles implied different ecological conditions between the two particles pools, and roles in the BCP. Molecular analyses of sinking and suspended particles constitute powerful diagnostic tools to study the eukaryotic influence on the BCP in a more holistic manner compared to classic carbon export studies focusing on sinking particles.},

Logically, fungal taxonomists should therefore leverage every opportunity to highlight and visualize the importance of taxonomic work, the usefulness of taxonomic data far beyond taxonomy, and the integrative and collaborative nature of modern taxonomy at large. Is mycology really doing that, though? In this study, we went through ten years' worth (2009--2018) of species descriptions of extant fungal taxa -- 1,097 studies describing at most ten new species -- in five major mycological journals plus one plant journal. We estimated the frequency at which a range of key words, illustrations, and concepts related to ecology, geography, taxonomy, molecular data, and data availability were provided with the descriptions. We also considered a range of science-demographical aspects such as gender bias and the rejuvenation of taxonomy and taxonomists as well as public availability of the results. Our results show that the target audience of fungal species descriptions appears to be other fungal taxonomists, because many aspects of the new species were presented only implicitly, if at all. Although many of the parameters we estimated show a gradual, and in some cases marked, change for the better over time, they still paint a somewhat bleak picture of mycological taxonomy as a male-dominated field where the wants and needs of an extended target audience are often not understood or even considered. This study hopes to leave a mark on the way fungal species are described by putting the focus on ways in which fungal taxonomy can better anticipate the end users of species descriptions -- be they mycologists, other researchers, the public at large, or even algorithms. In the end, fungal taxonomy, too, is likely to benefit from such measures.},

We provide a methodology for reclassifying NWI polygons into Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes to facilitate monitoring wetland functions. We conducted this reclassification using spatial and attribute queries within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for wetlands in central Oklahoma. Once classified, 149 randomly selected wetlands in four HGM classes (depressional, lacustrine fringe, riverine, and impounded depressional) were field verified. The overall accuracy of the GIS classification was 60\%. Inherent issues with NWI due to attribute accuracy, spatial accuracy, and map age accounted for {$>$}50\% of the misclassified sites in this analysis. The results from this analysis were also used to provide an inventory of wetlands in each HGM class and subclass based on user's accuracy metrics. Reclassifying NWI polygons into HGM classes can assist with determining the spatial distribution and relative abundance of specific wetland classes which allows for more focused wetland restoration and monitoring efforts. However, the error rate associated with reclassification should be calculated to ensure that incorrect conclusions are not drawn regarding the abundance of HGM wetland classes and their associated functions.},

  abstract = {abstract Sexual reproduction is a ubiquitous feature of the eukaryotic kingdom with the many benefits of sex in generating genetic diversity as substrates for evolutionary selection being well known. When two different partners come together, there is the generation of genetic variation in the offspring, through the processes of crossover and recombination during meiosis, enabling response of future generations to environmental selection pressures (1 -- 4). Sexual reproduction also allows the repair of random epigenetic or conventional genetic damage by recombination with homologous chromosomes and can mask lethal mutations (4, 5). In addition, sexual recombination alleviates clonal interference and prevents deleterious mutations hitchhiking to fixation (6). Indeed, there are so many benefits to sexual reproduction that exceptions that are purely asexual have been termed ``evolutionary scandals'' (7). As a result, supposed ancient asexual species such as the bdelloid rotifers (an exclusively female class of over 460 rotifer species thought to date back several million years) and darwinulid ostracods (a family of around 30 crustacean species thought to have been exclusively female and asexual for over 200 million years, but for which very rare living males have recently been described) have gained notoriety (8 -- 0). It therefore comes as a great surprise that, until recently, approximately 20\% of all fungal species were considered to reproduce only by asexual means, with no recognized sexual cycle, based on knowledge of described fungal species (11, 12). Indeed, in some phylogenetic groupings such as the Ascomycotina, up to 40\% of taxa surveyed were deemed to be asexual (13). This is despite the fact that sexual reproduction in fungi can have additional benefits such as the production of fruit bodies and sexual spores that are resistant to adverse environmental conditions, thereby promoting survival of sexual offspring; it can provide a transient diploid arena for selection of genes; and sex can favorably impact genome evolution (14 -- 17). Asexual species are also proposed to be short-lived evolutionary ``dead ends'' subject to rapid extinction (12, 18). Fungal species lacking a known sexual cycle have been referred to as ``imperfect'' or ``mitosporic'' fungi and have been grouped into the ``Fungi Imperfecti'' or ``Deuteromycota,'' although phylogenetic analysis has shown that these are artificial groupings not based on taxonomic relationship (19). The terms ``asexual'' and ``imperfect'' are used synonymously in this review.},

  abstract = {Current methods for inference of phylogenetic trees require running complex pipelines at substantial computational and labor costs, with additional constraints in sequencing coverage, assembly and annotation quality, especially for large datasets. To overcome these challenges, we present Read2Tree, which directly processes raw sequencing reads into groups of corresponding genes and bypasses traditional steps in phylogeny inference, such as genome assembly, annotation and all-versus-all sequence comparisons, while retaining accuracy. In a benchmark encompassing a broad variety of datasets, Read2Tree is 10--100 times faster than assembly-based approaches and in most cases more accurate---the exception being when sequencing coverage is high and reference species very distant. Here, to illustrate the broad applicability of the tool, we reconstruct a yeast tree of life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution. We also apply Read2Tree to {$>$}10,000 Coronaviridae samples, accurately classifying highly diverse animal samples and near-identical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sequences on a single tree. The speed, accuracy and versatility of Read2Tree enable comparative genomics at scale.},

We examined a potential case of adaptation to novel visual environments in a species flock (Great Lakes salmonids, genus \emph{Coregonus}) using a new amplicon genotyping protocol on the Oxford Nanopore Flongle. Five visual opsin genes were amplified for individuals of \emph{C. artedi, C. hoyi, C. kiyi}, and \emph{C. zenithicus}. Comparisons revealed species-specific differences in the coding sequence of \emph{rhodopsin} (Tyr261Phe substitution), suggesting local adaptation by \emph{C. kiyi} to the blue-shifted depths of Lake Superior. Parallel evolution and ``toggling'' at this amino acid residue has occurred several times across the fish tree of life, resulting in identical changes to the visual systems of distantly related taxa across replicated environmental gradients. Our results suggest that ecological differences and local adaptation to distinct visual environments are strong drivers of both evolutionary parallelism and diversification.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A data set of LSU DNA sequences of mainly European Russula and Lactarius species was subjected to molecular phylogenetic analysis. Species could be allocated to six clades, with an unresolved phylogeny. One of these clades represents the genus Lactarius. The only analysed species of the section Archaeinae (Russula) was placed basal to both genera. Thus Lactarius appears to be derived from Russula. Russula was divided into four clusters, corresponding to the sections Plorantinae and Nigricantinae, subgenus Heterophyllidia including the section Foetentinae, and a cluster representing the remaining subgenera of the ``Genuinae''. Even though the resulting groups can be considered as valid classificatory groups, species associations resulting from molecular analyses neither support the division of Russula into the subgenus Compacta (including the sections Nigricantinae, Plorantinae, and Archaeinae) and the ``Genuinae'' (including all remaining taxa), nor do they support previously proposed evolutionary lineages within the ``Genuinae''. Ribosomal ITS DNA sequences of Russula species were analysed to achieve better infrageneric resolution. The results are discussed in relation to current classification systems and to what is known about the mycorrhizae formed by Russula species. While the systematic value attached to many macroscopic and microscopic sporocarp features was not supported by sequence data, mycorrhizal anatomy is in good correspondence with many of the results from the phylogenetic analysis.},

We recognise seven European species within this section, three of which are described as new: Hebeloma alboerumpens, H. griseopruinatum and H. parvicystidiatum. The first two of these species appear to be ectomycorrhizal with Cistaceae: Cistus and Helianthemum. Hebeloma parvicystidiatum is more likely to be in mycorrhizal association with Quercus spp. We also provide a key to the European species within sect. Theobromina and an updated key of known Hebeloma associates of Cistus. Molecular analyses based on multiple loci further illustrate the distinctness of the newly described taxa and provide molecular evidence, supporting the morphological evidence, for the relationship that exists among species of this section. The ITS is the only one from the sequenced loci that, alongside with morphology, distinguishes among all of the species of sect. Theobromina. The section gains most of its molecular support from the MCM7 locus, followed by RPB2.},

  abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.},

UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences.

Taxonomy prediction is a fundamental step in such studies. The SINTAX algorithm predicts taxonomy by using \emph{k}-mer similarity to identify the top hit in a reference database and provides bootstrap confidence for all ranks in the prediction. SINTAX achieves comparable or better accuracy to the RDP Naive Bayesian Classifier with a simpler algorithm that does not require training. Most tested methods are shown to have high rates of over-classification errors where novel taxa are incorrectly predicted to have known names.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Most experimentally observed sequences are diverged from reference sequences of authoritatively named organisms, creating a challenge for prediction methods. I assessed the accuracy of several algorithms using cross-validation by identity, a new benchmark strategy which explicitly models the variation in distances between query sequences and the closest entry in a reference database. When the accuracy of genus predictions was averaged over a representative range of identities with the reference database (100\%, 99\%, 97\%, 95\% and 90\%), all tested methods had {$\leq$}50\% accuracy on the currently-popular V4 region of 16S rRNA. Accuracy was found to fall rapidly with identity; for example, better methods were found to have V4 genus prediction accuracy of {$\sim$}100\% at 100\% identity but {$\sim$}50\% at 97\% identity. The relationship between identity and taxonomy was quantified as the probability that a rank is the lowest shared by a pair of sequences with a given pair-wise identity. With the V4 region, 95\% identity was found to be a twilight zone where taxonomy is highly ambiguous because the probabilities that the lowest shared rank between pairs of sequences is genus, family, order or class are approximately equal.},

Specialized 16S rRNA databases have been developed to support this approach including Greengenes, RDP and SILVA. Most taxonomy annotations in these databases are predictions from sequence rather than authoritative assignments based on studies of type strains or isolates. In this work, I investigated the taxonomy annotations and guide trees provided by these databases. Using a blinded test, I estimated that the annotation error rate of the RDP database is {$\sim$}10\%. The branching orders of the Greengenes and SILVA guide trees were found to disagree at comparable rates with each other and with taxonomy annotations according to the training set (authoritative reference) provided by RDP, indicating that the trees have comparable quality. Pervasive conflicts between tree branching order and type strain taxonomies strongly suggest that the guide trees are unreliable guides to phylogeny. I found 249,490 identical sequences with conflicting annotations in SILVA v128 and Greengenes v13.5 at ranks up to phylum (7,804 conflicts), indicating that the annotation error rate in these databases is {$\sim$}17\%.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of marker genes such as 16S ribosomal RNA is widely used to survey microbial communities. The in-sample (alpha) diversity of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) is often summarized by metrics such as richness or entropy which are calculated from observed abundances, or by estimators such as Chao1 which extrapolate to unobserved OTUs. Most such measures are adopted from traditional biodiversity studies, where observational error can often be neglected. However, errors introduced by next-generation amplicon sequencing tend to induce spurious OTUs and spurious counts in OTU tables, both of which are especially prevalent at low abundances. In consequence, traditional metrics may be grossly inaccurate if they are naively applied to NGS OTU tables. In this work, we describe two novel alpha diversity estimators which are calculated from OTU abundances above a specified threshold. The singleton-free estimator (SFE) is a non-parametric estimator which is derived from a similar approach to Chao1 but extrapolates using doublet and triplet abundances rather than singletons and doublets. The octave estimator (OE) fits a log-normal distribution to non-singleton bars of an octave plot. We show that these estimators are effective under suitable conditions, but these conditions rarely apply in practice. We conclude that extrapolating to unobserved OTUs remains an open problem which is unlikely to be solved in the near future.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic tree confidence is often estimated from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using the Felsenstein bootstrap heuristic. However, this does not account for systematic errors in the MSA, which may cause substantial bias to the inferred phylogeny. Here, I describe the MSA ensemble bootstrap, a new procedure which generates a set of replicate MSAs by varying parameters such as gap penalties and substitution scores. Such an ensemble is called diagnostic if the typical distance between MSAs is comparable to the error rate. Confidence in a prediction derived from an MSA, e.g. a monophyletic clade, is expressed as the fraction of the ensemble where the prediction is reproduced. This approach is implemented in MUSCLE by modifying the Probcons algorithm, which is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM). An ensemble is generated by perturbing HMM parameters and permuting the guide tree. Ensembles generated by this method are shown to be diagnostic on the Balibase benchmark. To enable scaling to large datasets, divide-and-conquer heuristics are introduced. A new benchmark (Balifam) is described with 36 sets of 10000+ proteins. On Balifam, ensembles generated by MUSCLE are shown to align an average of 59\% of columns correctly, 13\% better than Clustal-omega (52\% correct) and 26\% better than MAFFT (47\% correct). The ensemble bootstrap is applied to a previously published tree of RNA viruses, showing that the high reported Felsenstein bootstrap confidence of Ribovirus phylum branching order is an artifact of systematic MSA errors.

The minimizer of a string of w consecutive k-mers is the k-mer with smallest value according to an ordering of all k-mers. Syncmers are defined here as a family of alternative methods which select k-mers by inspecting the position of the smallest-valued substring of length s {$<$} k within the k-mer. For example, a closed syncmer is selected if its smallest s-mer is at the start or end of the k-mer. At least one closed syncmer must be found in every window of length (k - s) k-mers. Unlike a minimizer, a syncmer is identified by its sequence alone, and is therefore synchronized in the following sense: if a given k-mer is selected from one sequence, it will also be selected from any other sequence. Also, minimizers can be deleted by mutations in flanking sequence, which cannot happen with syncmers. Experiments on minimizers with parameters used in the minimap2 read mapper and Kraken taxonomy prediction algorithm respectively show that syncmers can simultaneously achieve both lower density and higher conservation compared to minimizers.},

The expansion of commercial harvesting in many parts of the world has led to widespread concern about overharvesting and possible damage to fungal resources. In 1975, we started a field research project to investigate the effects of mushroom picking on fruit body occurrence. The three treatments applied were the harvesting techniques picking and cutting, and the concomitant trampling of the forest floor. The results reveal that, contrary to expectations, long-term and systematic harvesting reduces neither the future yields of fruit bodies nor the species richness of wild forest fungi, irrespective of whether the harvesting technique was picking or cutting. Forest floor trampling does, however, reduce fruit body numbers, but our data show no evidence that trampling damaged the soil mycelia in the studied time period.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83\% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding can rapidly determine the species composition of bulk samples and thus aids biodiversity and ecosystem assessment. However, it is essential to use primer sets that minimize amplification bias among taxa to maximize species recovery. Despite this fact, the performance of primer sets employed for metabarcoding terrestrial arthropods has not been sufficiently evaluated. This study tests the performance of 36 primer sets on a mock community containing 374 insect species. Amplification success was assessed with gradient PCRs and the 21 most promising primer sets selected for metabarcoding. These 21 primer sets were also tested by metabarcoding a Malaise trap sample. We identified eight primer sets, mainly those including inosine and/or high degeneracy, that recovered more than 95\% of the species in the mock community. Results from the Malaise trap sample were congruent with the mock community, but primer sets generating short amplicons produced potential false positives. Taxon recovery from both mock community and Malaise trap sample metabarcoding were used to select four primer sets for additional evaluation at different annealing temperatures (40--60 {$^\circ$}C) using the mock community. The effect of temperature varied by primer pair but overall it only had a minor effect on taxon recovery. This study reveals the weak performance of some primer sets employed in past studies. It also demonstrates that certain primer sets can recover most taxa in a diverse species assemblage. Thus, based our experimental set up, there is no need to employ several primer sets targeting the same gene region. We identify several suitable primer sets for arthropod metabarcoding, and specifically recommend BF3 + BR2, as it is not affected by primer slippage and provides maximal taxonomic resolution. The fwhF2 + fwhR2n primer set amplifies a shorter fragment and is therefore ideal when targeting degraded DNA (e.g., from gut contents).},

  abstract = {Elucidating the connection between genotype, phenotype, and adaptation in wild populations is fundamental to the study of evolutionary biology, yet it remains an elusive goal, particularly for microscopic taxa, which comprise the majority of life. Even for microbes that can be reliably found in the wild, defining the boundaries of their populations and discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes has proved extremely difficult. Here, we have circumvented these issues in the microbial eukaryote Neurospora crassa by using a ``reverse-ecology'' population genomic approach that is free of a priori assumptions about candidate adaptive alleles. We performed Illumina whole-transcriptome sequencing of 48 individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. From these data, we discovered two cryptic and recently diverged populations, one in the tropical Caribbean basin and the other endemic to subtropical Louisiana. We conducted high-resolution scans for chromosomal regions of extreme divergence between these populations and found two such genomic ``islands.'' Through growth-rate assays, we found that the subtropical Louisiana population has a higher fitness at low temperature (10 {$^\circ$}C) and that several of the genes within these distinct regions have functions related to the response to cold temperature. These results suggest the divergence islands may be the result of local adaptation to the 9 {$^\circ$}C difference in average yearly minimum temperature between these two populations. Remarkably, another of the genes identified using this unbiased, whole-genome approach is the well-known circadian oscillator frequency, suggesting that the 2.4{$^\circ$}--10.6{$^\circ$} difference in latitude between the populations may be another important environmental parameter.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

  abstract = {The phytoplankton biomass in the Baltic Sea is low during the cold-water season (October to May) compared to the warm-water season (June to September). However, the sea ice is a habitat for diverse assemblages in polar and subpolar areas. These areas, including the Baltic Sea, are subject to changing environmental conditions due to global warming, and temporal and spatial studies are required to understand changes in the processes the organisms are involved in. We delineated microalgal succession in the northern Baltic Sea during the cold-water season using a weekly collected data set. Microscopy results together with molecular methods showed that 5 microbial groups could be distinguished: the sea-ice microalgal assemblage and 4 phytoplankton assemblages (fall, winter, under-ice water and spring). Based on cell enumeration, the microalgal biomass in the water column remained low until the end of the ice-covered season and was dominated by small flagellates and dinoflagellates. The young-ice assemblage in January resembled the water-column assemblage, but indicated a partly selective species-concentrating mechanism during ice formation due to lower species richness in ice than in the water column. Biomass of microalgae increased in the ice and water column during the March to May period, and the assemblage changed from flagellate-dominated to diatom- and dinoflagellate-dominated. The result that the spring phytoplankton, based on species and biomass, formed a separate assemblage indicates that sea-ice algae did not contribute to the spring bloom phytoplankton assemblage.},

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.},

  abstract = {Bacteria comprise the most diverse domain of life on Earth, where they occupy nearly every possible ecological niche and play key roles in biological and chemical processes. Studying the composition and ecology of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function are of prime importance. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon taxonomic assignments through reference data bases or clustering approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related organisms in complex microbial data sets. In this paper, we describe oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in environmental data sets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the canonical approaches. Our analysis of two data sets from two different environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating distinct microbial populations of ecological importance. Oligotyping can resolve the distribution of closely related organisms across environments and unveil previously overlooked ecological patterns for microbial communities.

  abstract = {Molecular microbial ecology investigations often employ large marker gene datasets, for example, ribosomal RNAs, to represent the occurrence of single-cell genomes in microbial communities. Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies enable extensive surveys of marker gene libraries that sometimes include nearly identical sequences. Computational approaches that rely on pairwise sequence alignments for similarity assessment and de novo clustering with de facto similarity thresholds to partition high-throughput sequencing datasets constrain fine-scale resolution descriptions of microbial communities. Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) provides a computationally efficient means to partition marker gene datasets into `MED nodes', which represent homogeneous operational taxonomic units. By employing Shannon entropy, MED uses only the information-rich nucleotide positions across reads and iteratively partitions large datasets while omitting stochastic variation. When applied to analyses of microbiomes from two deep-sea cryptic sponges Hexadella dedritifera and Hexadella cf. dedritifera, MED resolved a key Gammaproteobacteria cluster into multiple MED nodes that are specific to different sponges, and revealed that these closely related sympatric sponge species maintain distinct microbial communities. MED analysis of a previously published human oral microbiome dataset also revealed that taxa separated by less than 1\% sequence variation distributed to distinct niches in the oral cavity. The information theory-guided decomposition process behind the MED algorithm enables sensitive discrimination of closely related organisms in marker gene amplicon datasets without relying on extensive computational heuristics and user supervision.},

Because fungi have been excellent model organisms for trail-blazing basic research since the adoption of Neurospora crassa as one of the workhorses for genetics in the 1940s (1), much of the foundation for general knowledge of eukaryotes was first uncovered with fungi, specifically the four species uniquely suited for genetics, biochemistry, and genomics: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus nidulans, and N. crassa.

Here, we amplified and sequenced the ITS and LSU regions of the rDNA operon (around 1500 bp) from grassland soils using PacBio SMRT sequencing. We tested how three different methods for generation of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) effected estimated richness and identified taxa, and how well large-scale ecological patterns associated with shifting environmental conditions were recovered in data from the three methods. The field site at Kungs{\"a}ngen Nature Reserve has drawn frequent visitors since Linnaeus's time, and its species rich vegetation includes the largest population of Fritillaria meleagris in Sweden. To test the effect of different OTU generation methods, we sampled soils across an abrupt moisture transition that divides the meadow community into a Carex acuta dominated plant community with low species richness in the wetter part, which is visually distinct from the mesic-dry part that has a species rich grass-dominated plant community including a high frequency of F. meleagris. We used the moisture and plant community transition as a framework to investigate how detected belowground microeukaryotic community composition was influenced by OTU generation methods. Soil communities in both moisture regimes were dominated by protists, a large fraction of which were taxonomically assigned to Ciliophora (Alveolata) while 30\%--40\% of all reads were assigned to kingdom Fungi. Ecological patterns were consistently recovered irrespective of OTU generation method used. However, different methods strongly affect richness estimates and the taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution of the characterized community with implications for how well members of the microeukaryotic communities can be recognized in the data.},

COX is present in many bacterial and most eukaryotic lineages, but its origin has remained elusive. After examining previous proposals for COX evolution, the review summarizes recent insights suggesting that COX enzymes might have evolved in soil dwelling, probably iron-oxidizing bacteria which lived on emerged land over two billion years ago. These bacteria were the likely ancestors of extant acidophilic iron-oxidizers such as Acidithiobacillus spp., which belong to basal lineages of the phylum Proteobacteria. Proteobacteria may thus be considered the originators of COX, which was then laterally transferred to other prokaryotes. The taxonomy of bacteria is presented in relation to the current distribution of COX and C family oxidases, from which COX may have evolved.},

The general mixed Yule--coalescent (GMYC) was recently proposed as a potential means of increasing the rate of biodiversity exploration. We tested this method with simulated data and applied it to a group of poorly known bats (Hipposideros) from the Philippines. We then used echolocation call characteristics to evaluate the plausibility of species boundaries suggested by GMYC. In our simulations, GMYC performed relatively well (errors in estimated species diversity less than 25\%) when the product of the haploid effective population size (Ne) and speciation rate (SR; per lineage per million years) was less than or equal to 105, while interspecific variation in Ne was twofold or less. However, at higher but also biologically relevant values of Ne {\texttimes} SR and when Ne varied tenfold among species, performance was very poor. GMYC analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from Philippine Hipposideros suggest actual diversity may be approximately twice the current estimate, and available echolocation call data are mostly consistent with GMYC delimitations. In conclusion, we consider the GMYC model useful under some conditions, but additional information on Ne, SR and/or corroboration from independent character data are needed to allow meaningful interpretation of results.},

In this type of mutualism, each host individual can interact with many symbionts, whereas each individual symbiont can interact with only one host individual. Partner choice by the host is a potentially critical mechanism for maintaining such systems; however, its long-term effects on the coevolution between the hosts and symbionts have not been completely explored. In this study, I developed a simple mathematical model to describe the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and symbionts in a one-to-many mutualism. I assumed that each host chooses a constant number of symbionts from a potential symbiont population, a fraction of which are chosen through preferential choice on the basis of the cooperativeness of the symbionts and the rest are chosen randomly. Using numerical calculations, I found that mutualism is maintained when the preferential choice is not very costly and the mutation rate of symbionts is large. I also found that symbionts that receive benefits from hosts without a return (cheater symbionts) and hosts that do not engage in preferential partner choice (indiscriminator hosts) can coexist with mutualist symbionts and discriminator hosts, respectively. The parameter domain of pure mutualism, i.e., free from cheater symbionts and indiscriminator hosts, can be narrower than the whole domain where the mutualism persists.},

  abstract = {To attain acceptable sample misassignment rates, current approaches to multiplex single-molecule real-time sequencing require upstream quality improvement, which is obtained from multiple passes over the sequenced insert and significantly reduces the effective read length. In order to fully exploit the raw read length on multiplex applications, robust barcodes capable of dealing with the full single-pass error rates are needed.We present a method for designing sequencing barcodes that can withstand a large number of insertion, deletion and substitution errors and are suitable for use in multiplex single-molecule real-time sequencing. The manuscript focuses on the design of barcodes for full-length single-pass reads, impaired by challenging error rates in the order of 11\%. The proposed barcodes can multiplex hundreds or thousands of samples while achieving sample misassignment probabilities as low as 10-7 under the above conditions, and are designed to be compatible with chemical constraints imposed by the sequencing process.Software tools for constructing watermark barcode sets and demultiplexing barcoded reads, together with example sets of barcodes and synthetic barcoded reads, are freely available at www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/ezpeleta/NS-watermark.},

Here, we apply so-called NS-watermark barcodes, whose error correction capability was previously validated in silico, in a proof of concept where we synthesize 3840~NS-watermark barcodes and use them to asymmetrically tag and simultaneously sequence amplicons from two evolutionarily distant species~(namely Bordetella pertussis and Drosophila mojavensis) on the ONT~MinION~platform. To our knowledge, this is the largest number of distinct, non-random tags ever sequenced in parallel and the first report of microarray-based synthesis as a source for large oligonucleotide pools for barcoding. We recovered the identity of more than 86\% of the barcodes, with a crosstalk rate of 0.17\%~(i.e., one misassignment every 584~reads). This falls in the range of the index hopping rate of established, high-accuracy Illumina sequencing, despite the increased number of tags and the relatively low accuracy of both microarray-based synthesis and long-read sequencing. The robustness of NS-watermark barcodes, together with their scalable design and compatibility with low-cost massive synthesis, makes them promising for present and future sequencing applications requiring massive labeling, such as long-read single-cell RNA-Seq.},

This study aims at identifying the most popular wild edible mushrooms in the << Monts Kouff{\`e} >> area in Benin. This study was carried out from July to August 2014, firstly consisted of an ethnomycological survey on 100 individuals randomly selected within four ethnic groups (Nagot, Betamarib{\'e}, Peuhl and Lokpa) within two forest villages (Manigri-Oke and Manigri-Ikani) of the township of Bassila in the center of Benin. This survey was followed by a mycological inventory in representative natural ecosystems of the study area, enabling on the base of investigations to identify wild edible mushrooms the most consumed according to sociolinguistic group. The technique of simple and Matrix ranking and a Factorial Analysis of Correspondence were performed for the identification of mushrooms. Nineteen (19) edible species, dominated by Termitomyces species, are mainly exploited for food purposes. Ten of these species has been identified as priority for feeding of sociolinguistic groups~ of <<Monts Kouff{\`e}>>. The results showed that the Nagot people use more fungal resources (18 edible species) than the Peuhl (14), the Betamarib{\'e} (12) and the Lokpa (9). As a result of the great use of mushrooms by local people of << Monts Kouff{\`e} >> area, it is necessary today to find a compromise for sustainable exploitation of these resources through a sustainable management of their habitat and the promotion of wild edible mushroom sector in West Africa.Keywords: Ethnomycology, edible fungi, food priority species, Monts- Kouff{\`e} area, Benin},

  abstract = {Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

Direct sequencing of full length rRNA genes is currently limited by read length using second generation sequencing or sacrificed quality and throughput by using single molecule sequencing. We developed a novel method to sequence and assemble nearly full length rRNA genes using second generation sequencing.Benchmarking was performed on mock bacterial and fungal communities as well as two forest soil samples. The majority of rRNA gene sequences of all species in the mock community samples were successfully recovered with identities above 99.5\% compared to the reference sequences. For soil samples we obtained exquisite coverage with identification of a large number of putative new species, as well as high abundance correlation between replicates. This approach provides a cost-effective method for obtaining extensive and accurate information on complex environmental microbial communities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, formed between the majority of land plants and ubiquitous soil fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota, is responsible for massive nutrient transfer and global carbon sequestration. AM fungi take up nutrients from the soil and exchange them against photosynthetically fixed carbon (C) from the host. Recent studies have demonstrated that reciprocal reward strategies by plant and fungal partners guarantee a ``fair trade'' of phosphorus against C between partners [Kiers ET, et al. (2011) Science 333:880--882], but whether a similar reward mechanism also controls nitrogen (N) flux in the AM symbiosis is not known. Using mycorrhizal root organ cultures, we manipulated the C supply to the host and fungus and followed the uptake and transport of N sources in the AM symbiosis, the enzymatic activities of arginase and urease, and fungal gene expression in the extraradical and intraradical mycelium. We found that the C supply of the host plant triggers the uptake and transport of N in the symbiosis, and that the increase in N transport is orchestrated by changes in fungal gene expression. N transport in the symbiosis is stimulated only when the C is delivered by the host across the mycorrhizal interface, not when C is supplied directly to the fungal extraradical mycelium in the form of acetate. These findings support the importance of C flux from the root to the fungus as a key trigger for N uptake and transport and provide insight into the N transport regulation in the AM symbiosis.},

However, the fungus also supplied low-quality (shaded) hosts with nutrients and maintained a high colonization rate in these plants. Fungal P transport was correlated to the expression of MtPt4. The expression of the putative ammonium transporter 1723.m00046 was dependent on the fungal nutrient supply and was induced when the CMN had access to N. * Biological market theory has emerged as a tool with which the strategic investment of competing partners in trading networks can be studied. Our work demonstrates how fungal partners are able to retain bargaining power, despite being obligately dependent on their hosts.},

  abstract = {A simple method that combines an adapted ribosome isolation method and a common RNA extraction step has been developed for selective recovery of intact rRNA from natural microbial communities in soil. After mechanical cell lysis, ribosomes are separated by centrifugation steps, avoiding massive humic acid contamination and RNA degradation. The protocol accommodates the complex composition of soils by blocking adsorbing surfaces and humic acids with polyvinylpyrrolidone and bovine serum albumin. A usual RNA extraction step yields rRNA accessible for hybridization or reverse transcription-PCR. Hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes was used for group-specific yield comparison. By using a probe hybridizing to the 16S rRNA of the bacterial kingdom, total bacterial rRNA yield was estimated to be in the range of 0.2 microgram per g for different soils. Group-specific probes did not indicate a selectivity of the isolation procedure and differentiated the compositions of different soil microbial communities. The sequence diversity of the isolated RNA population was also revealed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription-PCR amplification products by using a region of the 16S rRNA as a target. The pattern obtained by this analysis differed from a similar one resulting from the separation of amplification products of community DNA preparations. This different view of the community composition is attributable to the correlation of ribosome numbers to the metabolic activity of bacteria in the habitat under observation.},

  abstract = {The composition of predominant soil bacteria during grassland succession was investigated in the Dutch Drentse A area. Five meadows, taken out of agricultural production at different time points, and one currently fertilized plot represented different stages of grassland succession. Since fertilization and agricultural production were stopped, the six plots showed a constant decline in the levels of nutrients and vegetation changes. The activity of the predominant bacteria was monitored by direct ribosome isolation from soil and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR products generated from bacterial 16S rRNA. The amounts of 16S rRNA of 20 predominant ribosome types per gram of soil were monitored via multiple competitive RT-PCR in six plots at different succession stages. These ribosome types mainly represented Bacillusand members of the Acidobacterium cluster and the {$\alpha$} subclass of the class Proteobacteria. The 20 16S rRNA molecules monitored represented approximately half of all bacterial soil rRNA which was estimated by dot blot hybridizations of soil rRNA with the Bacteria probe EUB338. The grasslands showed highly reproducible and specific shifts of bacterial ribosome type composition. The total bacterial ribosome level increased during the first years after agricultural production and fertilization stopped. This correlated with the collapse of the dominant Lolium perenne population and an increased rate of mineralization of organic matter. The results indicate that there is a true correlation between the total activity of the bacterial community in soil and the amount of bacterial ribosomes.},

  abstract = {The wild gourmet mushroom Boletus edulis and its close allies are of significant ecological and economic importance. They are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but despite their ubiquity there are still many unresolved issues with regard to the taxonomy, systematics and biogeography of this group of mushrooms. Most phylogenetic studies of Boletus so far have characterized samples from North America and Europe and little information is available on samples from other areas, including the ecologically and geographically diverse regions of China. Here we analyzed DNA sequence variation in three gene markers from samples of these mushrooms from across China and compared our findings with those from other representative regions. Our results revealed fifteen novel phylogenetic species (about one-third of the known species) and a newly identified lineage represented by Boletus sp. HKAS71346 from tropical Asia. The phylogenetic analyses support eastern Asia as the center of diversity for the porcini sensu stricto clade. Within this clade, B. edulis is the only known holarctic species. The majority of the other phylogenetic species are geographically restricted in their distributions. Furthermore, molecular dating and geological evidence suggest that this group of mushrooms originated during the Eocene in eastern Asia, followed by dispersal to and subsequent speciation in other parts of Asia, Europe, and the Americas from the middle Miocene through the early Pliocene. In contrast to the ancient dispersal of porcini in the strict sense in the Northern Hemisphere, the occurrence of B. reticulatus and B. edulis sensu lato in the Southern Hemisphere was probably due to recent human-mediated introductions.},

Staude species was determined on approximately 16 100 ha of relatively dry, mixed-conifer forest in the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon. Sampling of recently dead or live, symptomatic conifers produced 112 isolates of Armillaria from six tree species. Armillaria species identifications done by using a polymerase chain reaction based diagnostic and diploid--diploid pairings produced identical results: 108 of the isolates were Armillaria ostoyae (Romagn.) Herink and four were North American Biological Species X (NABS X). Five genets of A. ostoyae and one of NABS X were identified through the use of somatic incompatibility pairings among the putatively diploid isolates. Armillaria ostoyae genet sizes were approximately 20, 95, 195, 260, and 965 ha; cumulative colonization of the study area was at least 9.5\%. The maximum distance between isolates from the 965-ha A. ostoyae genet was approximately 3810 m, and use of three estimates of A. ostoyae spread rate in conifer forests resulted in age estimates for the genet ranging from 1900 to 8650 years. Results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms that influenced the establishment, expansion, and expression of these genets; the genetic structure and stability of Armillaria; and the implications for disease management in this and similar forests.},

Ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) from all organisms undergo both exo- and endonucleolytic processing. Also, in all organisms, rRNA processing occurs inside large preribosomal particles and is coupled to nucleotide modification, folding of the precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA), and assembly of the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). In this review, we focus on the processing pathway of pre-rRNAs of cytoplasmic ribosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, without doubt, the organism where this pathway is best characterized. We summarize the current understanding of the rRNA maturation process, particularly focusing on the pre-rRNA processing sites, the enzymes responsible for the cleavage or trimming reactions and the different mechanisms that monitor and regulate the pathway. Strikingly, the overall order of the various processing steps is reasonably well conserved in eukaryotes, perhaps reflecting common principles for orchestrating the concomitant events of pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly.},

  abstract = {Comparing a biological sequence to a family of sequences is an important task in Bioinformatics, commonly performed using tools such as HMMer. The Viterbi algorithm is applied as HMMer main step to compute the similarity between the sequence and the family. Due to the exponential growth of biological sequence databases, implementations of the Viterbi algorithm on several high performance platforms have been proposed. Nevertheless, few implementations of the Viterbi algorithm use GPUs as main platform. In this paper, we present the development and optimization of an accelerator for the Viterbi algorithm applied to biological sequence analysis on GPUs. Some of the optimizations analyzed are applied to the sequence comparison problem for the first time in the literature and others are evaluated in more depth than in related works. Our main contributions are: (a) an accelerator that achieves speedups up to 102.90 and 60.46, with respect to HMMer2 and HMMer3 execution on a general purpose computer, respectively, (b) the use of the multi-platform OpenCL programming model for the accelerator, (c) a detailed evaluation of several optimizations such as memory, control flow, execution space, instruction scheduling, and loop optimizations, and (d) a methodology of optimizations and evaluation that can also be applied to other sequence comparison algorithms, such as the HMMer3 MSV.},

  abstract = {Abstract Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is increasingly used to study the present and past biodiversity. eDNA analyses often rely on amplification of very small quantities or degraded DNA. To avoid missing detection of taxa that are actually present (false negatives), multiple extractions and amplifications of the same samples are often performed. However, the level of replication needed for reliable estimates of the presence/absence patterns remains an unaddressed topic. Furthermore, degraded DNA and PCR/sequencing errors might produce false positives. We used simulations and empirical data to evaluate the level of replication required for accurate detection of targeted taxa in different contexts and to assess the performance of methods used to reduce the risk of false detections. Furthermore, we evaluated whether statistical approaches developed to estimate occupancy in the presence of observational errors can successfully estimate true prevalence, detection probability and false-positive rates. Replications reduced the rate of false negatives; the optimal level of replication was strongly dependent on the detection probability of taxa. Occupancy models successfully estimated true prevalence, detection probability and false-positive rates, but their performance increased with the number of replicates. At least eight PCR replicates should be performed if detection probability is not high, such as in ancient DNA studies. Multiple DNA extractions from the same sample yielded consistent results; in some cases, collecting multiple samples from the same locality allowed detecting more species. The optimal level of replication for accurate species detection strongly varies among studies and could be explicitly estimated to improve the reliability of results.},

Early biogeographers identified the existence of multiple zoogeographical regions, characterized by faunas with homogeneous composition that are separated by biogeographical boundaries. Yet, no study has deciphered the factors shaping the distributions of terrestrial biogeographical boundaries at the global scale. Here, using spatial regression analyses, we show that tectonic movements, sharp changes in climatic conditions and orographic barriers determine extant biogeographical boundaries. These factors lead to abrupt zoogeographical transitions when they act in concert, but their prominence varies across the globe. Clear differences exist among boundaries representing profound or shallow dissimilarities between faunas. Boundaries separating zoogeographical regions with limited divergence occur in areas with abrupt climatic transitions. In contrast, plate tectonics determine the separation between deeply divergent biogeographical realms, particularly in the Old World. Our study reveals the multiple drivers that have shaped the biogeographical regions of the world.},

  abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970--2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5--15\% (0.07--0.17 {$^\circ$}C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the surprising richness of soil bacterial communities; however, bacteria are not the only microorganisms found in soil. To our knowledge, no study has compared the diversities of the four major microbial taxa, i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses, from an individual soil sample. We used metagenomic and small-subunit RNA-based sequence analysis techniques to compare the estimated richness and evenness of these groups in prairie, desert, and rainforest soils. By grouping sequences at the 97\% sequence similarity level (an operational taxonomic unit [OTU]), we found that the archaeal and fungal communities were consistently less even than the bacterial communities. Although total richness levels are difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty, the estimated number of unique archaeal or fungal OTUs appears to rival or exceed the number of unique bacterial OTUs in each of the collected soils. In this first study to comprehensively survey viral communities using a metagenomic approach, we found that soil viruses are taxonomically diverse and distinct from the communities of viruses found in other environments that have been surveyed using a similar approach. Within each of the four microbial groups, we observed minimal taxonomic overlap between sites, suggesting that soil archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses are globally as well as locally diverse.},

  abstract = {This assessment is based on reviews of the extent of wetland inventory in seven regions of the world. A key conclusion is that little is still known about the extent and condition of the global wetland resource. It was not possible to make reliable overall estimates of the size of the wetland resource globally or regionally. Previous estimates range from 5.3 to 9.7 million km\textsuperscript{2} but present analyses now suggest a tentative minimum of 12.8 km\textsuperscript{2}. Recommendations focus on the need for national inventory programmes and the inclusion of basic information on the location and extent of each wetland and its major ecological features as a forerunner to collecting further management-oriented information. Thus, the following core data should be collected: area and boundary, location, geomorphic setting, general description, soil characteristics, water regime, water quality, and biotic characteristics. Further, the development of standardized methods for data collection, collation and storage are called for. These should address the use of remotely sensed data and storage of information in electronic formats, including Geographic Information Systems and recording key information in a meta-database. Habitats of priority for future inventory are seagrasses, coral reefs, salt marshes and coastal flats, mangroves, arid-zone wetlands, peatlands, rivers and streams, and artificial wetlands.}

In addition, sunlight properties such as intensity, duration, polarization, and spectral composition are used as sources of information (1). Indeed, all forms of life are continuously obtaining and decoding information from their environment. In fungi sunlight, ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared wavelengths, regulates a diversity of biological processes including circadian rhythms, morphogenesis, tropism, and synthesis of pigments, among others (reviewed in reference 1). UV light can be harmful, since DNA modification products of photochemical reactions may be transmitted to the next generation as a mutation. Visible light appears not only to provide early warning of the presence of impending UV radiation and further damage, but also seems to contribute to the capacity of these organisms to deal with abiotic stress in general (2 -- 5). Thus, the ability of most fungi to perceive and respond to light has very likely contributed to their survival and fitness.},

  abstract = {Ribosomal RNA genes have become the standard molecular markers for microbial community analysis for good reasons, including universal occurrence in cellular organisms, availability of large databases, and ease of rRNA gene region amplification and analysis. As markers, however, rRNA genes have some significant limitations. The rRNA genes are often present in multiple copies, unlike most protein-coding genes. The slow rate of change in rRNA genes means that multiple species sometimes share identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, while many more species share identical sequences in the short 16S rRNA regions commonly analyzed. In addition, the genes involved in many important processes are not distributed in a phylogenetically coherent manner, potentially due to gene loss or horizontal gene transfer. While rRNA genes remain the most commonly used markers, key genes in ecologically important pathways, e.g., those involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling, can provide important insights into community composition and function not obtainable through rRNA analysis. However, working with ecofunctional gene data requires some tools beyond those required for rRNA analysis. To address this, our Functional Gene Pipeline and Repository (FunGene; http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/) offers databases of many common ecofunctional genes and proteins, as well as integrated tools that allow researchers to browse these collections and choose subsets for further analysis, build phylogenetic trees, test primers and probes for coverage, and download aligned sequences. Additional FunGene tools are specialized to process coding gene amplicon data. For example, FrameBot produces frameshift-corrected protein and DNA sequences from raw reads while finding the most closely related protein reference sequence. These tools can help provide better insight into microbial communities by directly studying key genes involved in important ecological processes.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in global ecology is the identification of key functional processes in ecosystems that scale, but do not require, data for individual species across landscapes. Given that nearly all tree species form symbiotic relationships with one of two types of mycorrhizal fungi---arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi---and that AM- and ECM-dominated forests often have distinct nutrient economies, the detection and mapping of mycorrhizae over large areas could provide valuable insights about fundamental ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling, species interactions, and overall forest productivity. We explored remotely sensed tree canopy spectral properties to detect underlying mycorrhizal association across a gradient of AM- and ECM-dominated forest plots. Statistical mining of reflectance, reflectance derivatives, and band differencing across moderate/high-resolution Landsat data revealed distinctly unique phenological signals that differentiated AM- and ECM-associations. This approach was trained and validated against measurements of tree species and mycorrhizal association across 140,000 trees throughout the temperate US. We were able to predict 77\% of the variation in mycorrhizal association distribution within the forest plots (p{$<$}0.001). The implications for this work move us towards mapping mycorrhizal association globally and advancing our understanding of biogeochemical cycling and other ecosystem processes.

Simulation remains the most important approach to testing the accuracy and robustness of phylogenetic inference methods. However, current simulation programs are limited, especially concerning realistic models for simulating insertions and deletions. We implement a portable and flexible application, named INDELible, for generating nucleotide, amino acid and codon sequence data by simulating insertions and deletions (indels) as well as substitutions. Indels are simulated under several models of indel-length distribution. The program implements a rich repertoire of substitution models, including the general unrestricted model and nonstationary nonhomogeneous models of nucleotide substitution, mixture, and partition models that account for heterogeneity among sites, and codon models that allow the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio to vary among sites and branches. With its many unique features, INDELible should be useful for evaluating the performance of many inference methods, including those for multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree inference, and ancestral sequence, or genome reconstruction.},

Environmental DNA (eDNA) from organisms can be captured in ecosystem samples and sequenced using metabarcoding, but processing large volumes of eDNA data and annotating sequences to recognized taxa remains computationally expensive. Speed and accuracy are two major bottlenecks in this critical step. Here, we evaluated the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process short eDNA sequences and associate them with taxonomic labels. Using a unique eDNA data set collected in highly diverse Tropical South America, we compared the speed and accuracy of CNNs with that of a well-known bioinformatic pipeline (OBITools) in processing a small region (60 bp) of the 12S ribosomal DNA targeting freshwater fishes. We found that the taxonomic labels from the CNNs were comparable to those from OBITools, with high correlation levels for the composition of the regional fish fauna. The CNNs enabled the processing of raw fastq files at a rate of approximately 1 million sequences per minute, which was about 150 times faster than with OBITools. Given the good performance of CNNs in the highly diverse ecosystem considered here, the development of more elaborate CNNs promises fast  deployment for future biodiversity inventories using eDNA.},

This definition is based on physiological and genetic criteria, but it is problematic for colonial organisms. We propose a definition based instead on the evolutionary criteria of alignment of fitness, export of fitness by germ-soma specialization, and adaptive functional organization. We consider how these concepts apply to various putative individual organisms. We conclude that complex multicellular organisms and colonies of eusocial insects satisfy these three criteria, but that, in most cases (with at least one notable exception), colonies of modular organisms and genetic chimeras do not. While species do not meet these criteria, they may meet the criteria for a broader concept---that of an evolutionary individual---and sexual reproduction may be a species-level exaptation for enhancing evolvability.

In undisturbed ecosystems, most such negative interactions will be limited through the coevolution of fungi with their hosts. In this article, we explore what happens when pathogenic fungi spread beyond their natural ecological range and become invasive on na{\"i}ve hosts in new ecosystems. We will see that such invasive pathogens have been problematic to humans and their domesticated plant and animal species throughout history, and we will discuss some of the most pressing fungal threats of today.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic diversity in environmental samples is often assessed via PCR-based amplification of nSSU genes. However, estimates of diversity derived from pyrosequencing environmental data sets are often inflated, mainly because of the formation of chimeric sequences during PCR amplification. Chimeras are hybrid products composed of distinct parental sequences that can lead to the misinterpretation of diversity estimates. We have analyzed the effect of sample richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity on the formation of chimeras using a nSSU data set derived from 454 Roche pyrosequencing of replicated, large control pools of closely and distantly related nematode mock communities, of known intragenomic identity and richness. To further investigate how chimeric molecules are formed, the nSSU gene secondary structure was analyzed in several individuals. For the first time in eukaryotes, chimera formation proved to be higher in both richer and more genetically diverse samples, thus providing a novel perspective of chimera formation in pyrosequenced environmental data sets. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms involved in chimera formation during PCR amplification of environmentally derived DNA. Moreover, given the similarities between biodiversity analyses using amplicon sequencing and those used to assess genomic variation, our findings have potential broad application for identifying genetic variation in homologous loci or multigene families in general.},

To evaluate the effects that amplicon clustering methods have on the discovery of novel diversity, we clustered an environmental marine high-throughput sequencing dataset of protist amplicons together with reference sequences from the taxonomically curated Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR(2)) database using three de novo approaches: sequence similarity networks, USEARCH, and Swarm. The potentially novel diversity uncovered by each clustering approach differed drastically in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and in the number of environmental amplicons in these novel diversity OTUs. Global pairwise alignment comparisons revealed that numerous amplicons classified as potentially novel by USEARCH and Swarm were more than 97\% similar to references of PR(2). Using shortest path analyses on sequence similarity network OTUs and Swarm OTUs we found additional novel diversity within OTUs that would have gone unnoticed without further exploiting their underlying network topologies. These results demonstrate that graph theory provides powerful tools for microbial ecology and the analysis of environmental high-throughput sequencing datasets. Furthermore, sequence similarity networks were most accurate in delineating novel diversity from previously discovered diversity.},

These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. Metacoder includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. Metacoder can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. Metacoder also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, metacoder can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.},

  abstract = {Fungi play critical roles in many ecosystems, cause serious diseases in plants and animals, and pose significant threats to human health and structural integrity problems in built environments. While most fungal diversity remains unknown, the development of PCR primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) combined with next-generation sequencing has substantially improved our ability to profile fungal microbial diversity. Although the high sequence variability in the ITS region facilitates more accurate species identification, it also makes multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis unreliable across evolutionarily distant fungi because the sequences are hard to align accurately. To address this issue, we created ghost-tree, a bioinformatics tool that integrates sequence data from two genetic markers into a single phylogenetic tree that can be used for diversity analyses. Our approach starts with a ``foundation'' phylogeny based on one genetic marker whose sequences can be aligned across organisms spanning divergent taxonomic groups (e.g., fungal families). Then, ``extension'' phylogenies are built for more closely related organisms (e.g., fungal species or strains) using a second more rapidly evolving genetic marker. These smaller phylogenies are then grafted onto the foundation tree by mapping taxonomic names such that each corresponding foundation-tree tip would branch into its new ``extension tree'' child.},

  abstract = {Targeted resequencing with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms can be used to efficiently interrogate the genomes of large numbers of individuals. A critical issue for research and applications using HTS data, especially from long-read platforms, is error in base calling arising from technological limits and bioinformatic algorithms. We found that the community standard long amplicon analysis (LAA) module from Pacific Biosciences is prone to substantial bioinformatic errors that raise concerns about findings based on this pipeline, prompting the need for a new method. A single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing-error correction and assembly pipeline, C3S-LAA, was developed for libraries of pooled amplicons. By uniquely leveraging the structure of SMRT sequence data (comprised of multiple low quality subreads from which higher quality circular consensus sequences are formed) to cluster raw reads, C3S-LAA produced accurate consensus sequences and assemblies of overlapping amplicons from single sample and multiplexed libraries. In contrast, despite read depths in excess of 100X per amplicon, the standard long amplicon analysis module from Pacific Biosciences generated unexpected numbers of amplicon sequences with substantial inaccuracies in the consensus sequences. A bootstrap analysis showed that the C3S-LAA pipeline per se was effective at removing bioinformatic sources of error, but in rare cases a read depth of nearly 400X was not sufficient to overcome minor but systematic errors inherent to amplification or sequencing. C3S-LAA uses a divide and conquer processing algorithm for SMRT amplicon-sequence data that generates accurate consensus sequences and local sequence assemblies. Solving the confounding bioinformatic source of error in LAA allowed for the identification of limited instances of errors due to DNA amplification or sequencing of homopolymeric nucleotide tracts. For research and development in genomics, C3S-LAA allows meaningful conclusions and biological inferences to be made from accurately polished sequence output.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is omnipresent in boreal forests, where it is assumed to benefit plant growth. However, experiments show inconsistent benefits for plants and volatility of individual partnerships, which calls for a re-evaluation of the presumed role of this symbiosis. We reconcile these inconsistencies by developing a model that demonstrates how mycorrhizal networking and market mechanisms shape the strategies of individual plants and fungi to promote symbiotic stability at the ecosystem level. The model predicts that plants switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines, in agreement with the frequency distribution of ectomycorrhizal colonization intensity across a wide-ranging data set. In line with observations in field-scale isotope labeling experiments, the model explains why ectomycorrhizal symbiosis does not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation. Instead, market mechanisms may generate self-stabilization of the mycorrhizal strategy via nitrogen depletion feedback, even if plant growth is ultimately reduced. We suggest that this feedback mechanism maintains the strong nitrogen limitation ubiquitous in boreal forests. The mechanism may also have the capacity to eliminate or even reverse the expected positive effect of rising CO2 on tree growth in strongly nitrogen-limited boreal forests.},

  abstract = {Summary Growth as an interconnected mycelial network is characteristic of filamentous fungi and has been subject to scientific investigation since the seminal works of Buller at the start of the 20th century (1 -- 3). We have increasingly detailed understanding of the fundamental cellular processes needed to form a network, such as hyphal tip growth (4), septation (5 , 6), hyphal orientation (7), branching (8), and fusion (9 -- 13) (Fig. 1A and C). In contrast, we know far less about the molecular events at the next physical scale that leads to hyphal aggregation and hyphal differentiation, and how these impact physiological processes such as long-distance resource distribution and biomass recycling. For example, while direct uptake and intrahyphal nutrient diffusion may be sufficient to sustain short-range local growth when resources are abundant (14), long-distance translocation is required to deliver nutrients at a sufficient rate to growing tips, particularly in fungi that form large networks on the forest floor that are too large to distribute nutrients through diffusion alone. We know little about the quantitative contribution of different potential transport pathways, such as cytoplasmic streaming, vesicle transport, growth-induced mass flow, or evaporative mass flow, to net fluxes and overall nutrient dynamics, and how they might vary between species and developmental stage (15 -- 17). Nevertheless, the behavior of the growing mycelial network emerges from the interaction of many such processes and requires an integrated view to understand the overall impact on fungal behavior (18 -- 20). Our understanding is further constrained by inferences drawn from a limited number of genetically tractable model filamentous species grown under laboratory conditions (abundant, evenly dispersed, low-molecular-weight resources, high relative humidity, constant light and temperature) compared with real-world conditions (patchy, recalcitrant, ephemeral resources, fluctuating temperature, light and relative humidity).},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in virtually every metazoan biological process, exerting a widespread impact on gene expression. MicroRNA repression is conferred by relatively short ``seed match'' sequences, although the degree of repression varies widely for individual target sites. The factors controlling whether, and to what extent, a target site is repressed are not fully understood. As an alternative to target prediction based on sequence alone, comparative genomics has emerged as an invaluable tool for identifying miRNA targets that are conserved by natural selection, and hence likely effective and important. Here we present a general method for quantifying conservation of miRNA seed match sites, separating it from background conservation, controlling for various biases, and predicting miRNA targets. This method is useful not only for generating predictions but also as a tool for empirically evaluating the importance of various target prediction criteria.},

LULU identifies errors by combining sequence similarity and co-occurrence patterns. To validate the LULU method, we use a unique data set of high quality survey data of vascular plants paired with plant ITS2 metabarcoding data of DNA extracted from soil from 130 sites in Denmark spanning major environmental gradients. OTU tables are produced with several different OTU definition algorithms and subsequently curated with LULU, and validated against field survey data. LULU curation consistently improves {$\alpha$}-diversity estimates and other biodiversity metrics, and does not require a sequence reference database; thus, it represents a promising method for reliable biodiversity estimation.},

An average of 1.40{\texttimes}10-17 mol bacterial PLFA cell-1 was found in bacteria extracted from 15 soils covering a wide range of pH and organic matter contents. With this factor, the bacterial biomass based on PLFA analyses of whole soil samples was calculated as 1.0--4.8 mg bacterial C g-1 soil C. The corresponding range based on microscopical counts was 0.3--3.0 mg bacterial C g-1 soil C. The recovery of bacteria from the soils using homogenization/centrifugation was 2.6--16\% (mean 8.7\%) measured by PLFA analysis, and 12--61\% (mean 26\%) measured as microscopical counts. The soil content of the PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6 was correlated with the ergosterol content (r=0.92), which supports the use of this PLFA as an indicator of fungal biomass. The ratio 18:2{$\omega$}6 to bacterial PLFA is therefore suggested as an index of the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio in soil. An advantage with the method based on PLFA analyses is that the same technique and even the same sample is used to determine both fungi and bacteria. The fungal:bacterial biomass ratio calculated in this way was positively correlated with the organic matter content of the soils (r=0.94).},

The objectives of this study were to determine which Pezizales appeared as sporocarps after a prescribed fire in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, and whether species of Pezizales formed mycorrhizas on ponderosa pine, whether or not they were detected from sporocarps. Forty-two sporocarp collections in five genera (Anthracobia, Morchella, Peziza, Scutellinia, Tricharina) of post-fire Pezizales produced ten restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types. We found no root tips colonized by species of post-fire Pezizales fruiting at our site. However, 15\% (6/39) of the RFLP types obtained from mycorrhizal roots within 32 soil cores were ascomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of the 18S nuclear ribosomal DNA gene indicated that four of the six RFLP types clustered with two genera of the Pezizales, Wilcoxina and Geopora. Subsequent analyses indicated that two of these mycobionts were probably Wilcoxina rehmii, one Geopora cooperi, and one Geopora sp. The identities of two types were not successfully determined with PCR-based methods. Results contribute knowledge about the above- and below-ground ascomycete community in a ponderosa pine forest after a low intensity fire.},

  abstract = {Fungi form diverse communities and play essential roles in many terrestrial ecosystems, yet there are methodological challenges in taxonomic and phylogenetic placement of fungi from environmental sequences. To address such challenges we investigated spatio-temporal structure of a fungal community using soil metabarcoding with four different sequencing strategies: short amplicon sequencing of the ITS2 region (300--400 bp) with Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent Ion S5, and PacBio RS II, all from the same PCR library, as well as long amplicon sequencing of the full ITS and partial LSU regions (1200--1600 bp) with PacBio RS II. Resulting community structure and diversity depended more on statistical method than sequencing technology. The use of long-amplicon sequencing enables construction of a phylogenetic tree from metabarcoding reads, which facilitates taxonomic identification of sequences. However, long reads present issues for denoising algorithms in diverse communities. We present a solution that splits the reads into shorter homologous regions prior to denoising, and then reconstructs the full denoised reads. In the choice between short and long amplicons, we suggest a hybrid approach using short amplicons for sampling breadth and depth, and long amplicons to characterize the local species pool for improved identification and phylogenetic analyses.},

  abstract = {Summary The significance of fungi in natural environments is extensive and profound. Their most obvious roles are as decomposers of organic materials and as animal and plant pathogens and symbionts. It is therefore obvious that they are of major importance in the global carbon cycle through such activities and as important determinants of plant growth and productivity. However, their importance in terms of nutrient and element cycling greatly extends beyond these core activities, and they are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of many other elements and substances, as well as many other related processes of environmental significance. The growing discipline of geomicrobiology addresses the roles of microorganisms in geological and geochemical processes (1 , 2), and geomycology can be considered to be a part of this topic that focuses on the fungi (3 , 4). The often clear demarcation between mycological and bacteriological research has ensured that the geoactive properties and significance of fungi have been unappreciated in wider geomicrobiological contexts. The range of prokaryotic metabolic diversity found in archaea and bacteria, including their abilities to use a variety of different terminal electron acceptors in respiration and effect redox transformations of many metal species (5 , 6), has also contributed to a narrow overall view of the significance of eukaryotic organisms in important biosphere processes. A recent collection of geomicrobiology review articles managed to completely exclude fungi (as well as algae), even to the extent of defining ``microbes'' as being only bacteria and archaea (7). Nevertheless, appreciation of fungi as agents of geochemical change is growing, and their significance is being discovered even in locations not usually regarded as prime fungal habitats, e.g., rocks, acid mine drainage, deep aquatic sediments, hydrothermal vents, and the igneous oceanic crust (8 -- 11). Their significance as bioweathering agents of rocks and minerals is probably better understood than bacterial roles (12), and this ability is of prime importance in the weathering of human structures in the built environment and cultural heritage (13 -- 15). On the positive side, the geoactive properties of fungi can be used for human benefit, and several aspects may contribute to providing solutions to several important global challenges. Geomycology is relevant to reclamation and revegetation of polluted habitats, bioremediation, nuclear decommissioning and radionuclide containment, biorecovery of important elements, and the production of novel biomaterials. This chapter outlines important geoactive properties of fungi in relation to important environmental processes, their positive and negative applications, and their impact on human society.},

The 95\% modeled downwind dispersal distance of basidiospores was calculated for each species. The 95\% modeled downwind dispersal distance increased with increasing cap height and decreasing basidiospore volume for the species sampled, with 95\% of basidiospores predicted to fall within 58 cm of the cap. Differences in anatomical characteristics of EMF species influence how far basidiospores are dispersed by wind.

  abstract = {1 Abstract Motivation Output from high throughput sequencing instruments often exceeds what is necessary to assay a single sample. To better utilize this capacity, multiple samples are independently tagged with a unique ``barcode'' sequence and are then pooled, or ``multiplexed'', and sequenced together. Classifying, or ``demultiplexing'', the reads involves decoding the barcode sequence. Although instruments estimate the probability of incorrectly calling each nucleobase, available demultiplexers do not consult those estimates or report classification error probabilities. Results We present Pheniqs, a fast and flexible sequence demultiplexer and quality analyzer. In addition to providing an efficient implementation of the widespread minimum distance decoder, Pheniqs introduces a novel Phred-adjusted maximum likelihood decoder that consults base calling quality scores and estimates the probability of a barcode decoding error. Setting an upper bound on the permissible error provides an intuitive way to control demultiplexing confidence and directly influence precision and recall. Pheniqs supports FASTQ and multiple Sequence Alignment/Map formats and uses auxiliary SAM tags to report both library classification and demultiplexing error probability. Evaluation on both real and semi-synthetic data indicates that Pheniqs is faster than existing demultiplexers, substantially when demultiplexing longer reads, and achieves greater accuracy by correctly reflecting quality measurements.

  abstract = {Systems biology increasingly relies on deep sequencing with combinatorial index tags to associate biological sequences with their sample, cell, or molecule of origin. Accurate data interpretation depends on the ability to classify sequences based on correct decoding of these combinatorial barcodes. The probability of correct decoding is influenced by both sequence quality and the number and arrangement of barcodes. The rising complexity of experimental designs calls for a probability model that accounts for both sequencing errors and random noise, generalizes to multiple combinatorial tags, and can handle any barcoding scheme. The needs for reproducibility and community benchmark standards demand a peer-reviewed tool that preserves decoding quality scores and provides tunable control over classification confidence that balances precision and recall. Moreover, continuous improvements in sequencing throughput require a fast, parallelized and scalable implementation.},

  abstract = {Question: Do regional species pools, landscape isolation or on-site constraints cause plants from different guilds to vary in their ability to colonize restored wetlands? Location: Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota, USA. Methods: Floristic surveys of 41 restored wetlands were made three and 12 years after reflooding to determine changes in local species pools for eight plant guilds. The effect of landscape isolation on colonization efficiency was evaluated for each guild by plotting local species pools against distance to nearby natural wetlands, and the relative importance of dispersal vs. on-site constraints in limiting colonization was explored by comparing the local species pools of restored and natural wetlands within the region. Results: Of the 517 wetland plant taxa occurring in the region, 50\% have established within 12 years. The proportion of the regional species pool represented in local species pools differed among guilds, with sedge-meadow perennials, emergent perennials and floating/submersed aquatics least represented (33-36\%) and annual guilds most represented (74-94\%). Colonization-to-extinction ratios suggest that floating/submersed aquatics have already reached a species equilibrium while sedge-meadow and emergent perennials are still accumulating species. Increasing distance to nearest wetlands decreased the proportion of the regional species pool present in local pools for all guilds except native annuals and woody plants. The maximum proportion predicted, assuming no distance constraint, was comparable to the lowest-diversity natural wetlands for most perennial guilds, and also lower than what was achieved in a planted, weeded restoration. Conclusions: A biotic constraints seem to limit the colonization of floating/submersed aquatics into natural or restored wetlands, whereas all other guilds are potentially constrained by dispersal or biotic factors (i.e. competition from invasive species). Using species pools to evaluate restoration progress revealed that immigration potential varies considerably among guilds, that local species richness does not necessarily correspond to immigration limitations, and that some guilds (e.g. sedge-meadow perennials) will likely benefit more than others from being planted at restoration sites.},

  abstract = {Thousands of wetland restorations have been done in the glaciated mid-continent of the United States. Wetlands in this region revegetate by natural recolonization after hydrology is restored. The floristic composition of the vegetation and seed banks of 10 restored wetlands in northern Iowa were compared to those of 10 adjacent natural wetlands to test the hypothesis that communities rapidly develop through natural recolonization. Restoration programs in the prairie pothole region assume that the efficient-community hypothesis is true: all plant species that can become established and survive under the environmental conditions found at a site will eventually be found growing there and/or will be found in its seed bank. Three years after restoration, natural wetlands had a mean of 46 species compared to 27 species for restored wetlands. Some guilds of species have significantly fewer (e.g., sedge meadow) or more (e.g., submersed aquatics) species in restored than natural wetlands. The distribution and abundance of most species at different elevations were significantly different in natural and restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands contained fewer species and fewer seeds than those of natural wetlands. There were, however, some similarities between the vegetation of restored and natural wetlands. Emergent species richness in restored wetlands was generally similar to that in natural wetlands, although there were fewer shallow emergent species in restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands, however, were not similar to those of natural wetlands in composition, mean species richness, or mean total seed density. Submersed aquatic, wet prairie, and sedge meadow species were not present in the seed banks of restored wetlands. These patterns of recolonization seem related to dispersal ability, indicating the efficient-community hypothesis cannot be completely accepted as a basis for restorations in the prairie pothole region.},

  abstract = {Compared to multicellular fungi and unicellular yeasts, unicellular fungi with free-living flagellated stages (zoospores) remain poorly known and their phylogenetic position is often unresolved. Recently, rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses of two atypical parasitic fungi with amoeboid zoospores and long kinetosomes, the sanchytrids Amoeboradix gromovi and Sanchytrium tribonematis, showed that they formed a monophyletic group without close affinity with known fungal clades. Here, we sequence single-cell genomes for both species to assess their phylogenetic position and evolution. Phylogenomic analyses using different protein datasets and a comprehensive taxon sampling result in an almost fully-resolved fungal tree, with Chytridiomycota as sister to all other fungi, and sanchytrids forming a well-supported, fast-evolving clade sister to Blastocladiomycota. Comparative genomic analyses across fungi and their allies (Holomycota) reveal an atypically reduced metabolic repertoire for sanchytrids. We infer three main independent flagellum losses from the distribution of over 60 flagellum-specific proteins across Holomycota. Based on sanchytrids' phylogenetic position and unique traits, we propose the designation of a novel phylum, Sanchytriomycota. In addition, our results indicate that most of the hyphal morphogenesis gene repertoire of multicellular fungi had already evolved in early holomycotan lineages.},

  abstract = {DNA barcodes are crucial in biodiversity analysis for building automatic identification systems that recognize known species and discover unseen species. Unlike human genome modeling, barcode-based invertebrate identification poses challenges in the vast diversity of species and taxonomic complexity. Among Transformer-based foundation models, BarcodeBERT excelled in species-level identification of invertebrates, highlighting the effectiveness of self-supervised pretraining on barcode-specific datasets. Recently, structured state space models (SSMs) have emerged, with a time complexity that scales sub-quadratically with the context length. SSMs provide an efficient parameterization of sequence modeling relative to attention-based architectures. Given the success of Mamba and Mamba-2 in natural language, we designed BarcodeMamba, a performant and efficient foundation model for DNA barcodes in biodiversity analysis. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study on the impacts of self-supervised training and tokenization methods, and compared both versions of Mamba layers in terms of expressiveness and their capacity to identify "unseen" species held back from training. Our study shows that BarcodeMamba has better performance than BarcodeBERT even when using only 8.3\% as many parameters, and improves accuracy to 99.2\% on species-level accuracy in linear probing without fine-tuning for "seen" species. In our scaling study, BarcodeMamba with 63.6\% of BarcodeBERT's parameters achieved 70.2\% genus-level accuracy 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) probing for unseen species. The code repository to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BarcodeMamba.},

The Tuber melanosporum br{\^u}l{\'e} is an interesting biological model for studying soil reaction (pH) and decarbonation--recarbonation soil processes associated with ectomycorrhizal plants and soil fauna communities. Over the past 10 years ,we have observed that (1) a high concentration of active carbonate and exchangeable Ca2+ in the soil favors T. melanosporum fruiting body production and larger br{\^u}l{\'e}s, (2) the amount of active carbonate is significantly higher and the total carbonate is significantly lower inside the T. melanosporum br{\^u}l{\'e} than outside the br{\^u}l{\'e}, (3) T. melanosporum ectomycorrhizae impact biodiversity and soil quality, and (4) the calciferous glands of Lumbricidae have an impact on soil reaction and carbonate availability in the br{\^u}l{\'e}s. Here we propose new hypotheses on ectomycorrhizal fungal ecology, soil biology, and inorganic C soil sinks, suggesting that (1) the model that best explains the cause and effect of all br{\^u}l{\'e} observations is a feedback process; (2) this model assumes that T. melanosporum's ability to modify soil properties has a direct impact on plant nutrition and degree of plant mycorrhization, and this hypothesis could have a considerable impact from the evolutionary standpoint of ectomycorrhizal fungi; and (3) the integrated action of T. melanosporum and/or other ectomycorrhizal fungal populations, and earthworms, could be of major importance in the cycling and sequestration of inorganic C in the soil.},

  abstract = {Patterns of geographic distribution and composition of fungal communities are still poorly understood. Widespread occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems and the unique richness of interactions of Sebacinales with plants make them a target group to study evolutionary events in the light of nutritional lifestyle. We inferred diversity patterns, phylogenetic structures and divergence times of Sebacinales with respect to their nutritional lifestyles by integrating data from fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analyses. Relaxed molecular clock analyses indicated that Sebacinales originated late Permian within Basidiomycota, and their split into Sebacinaceae and Serendipitaceae  nom .  prov . likely occurred during the late Jurassic and the early Cretaceous, coinciding with major diversifications of land plants. In Sebacinaceae, diversification of species with ectomycorrhizal lifestyle presumably started during the Paleocene. Lineage radiations of the core group of ericoid and cavendishioid mycorrhizal Sebacinales started probably in the Eocene, coinciding with diversification events of their hosts. The diversification of Sebacinales with jungermannioid interactions started during the Oligocene, and occurred much later than the diversification of their hosts. Sebacinales communities associated either with ectomycorrhizal plants, achlorophyllous orchids, ericoid and cavendishioid Ericaceae or liverworts were phylogenetically clustered and globally distributed. Major Sebacinales lineage diversifications started after the continents had drifted apart. We also briefly discuss dispersal patterns of extant Sebacinales.},

Progressive MSA methods start by aligning the most similar sequences and subsequently incorporate the remaining sequences, from leaf to root, based on a guide tree. Their accuracy declines substantially as the number of sequences is scaled up5. We introduce a regressive algorithm that enables MSA of up to 1.4 million sequences on a standard workstation and substantially improves accuracy on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences. Our regressive algorithm works the other way around from the progressive algorithm and begins by aligning the most dissimilar sequences. It uses an efficient divide-and-conquer strategy to run third-party alignment methods in linear time, regardless of their original complexity. Our approach will enable analyses of extremely large genomic datasets such as the recently announced Earth BioGenome Project, which comprises 1.5 million eukaryotic genomes6.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Mussununga, an oligotrophic sandy savanna ecosystem, comprises distinct physiognomies along fire, water and nutrient availability gradients. Grasslands and woodlands are constrained at the opposite poles of these gradients, with grasslands occurring in areas with poorer soils and higher levels of both water-stress and fire intensity. According to the stress-dominance hypothesis, one might expect the importance of competition for community assembly to increase from grasslands to woodlands. Assuming conservation of ecological niches within evolutionary lineages, this should increase phylogenetic overdispersion from grasslands towards woodlands. To test this, we calculated phylogenetic diversity and community structure using different null models as well as the phylogenetic signal of life form as a proxy of niche space. All indices indicate phylogenetic clustering for grasslands and phylogenetic overdispersion for woodlands. Considering that most life-forms showed a significant phylogenetic signal, findings indicate that competition and further density dependent factors may play a larger role in community assembly of physiognomies in less harsh positions along the gradient, while environmental filtering dominates the harsher positions. Our results indicate that the entire gradient should receive conservation priority in order to guarantee the effective conservation of this endangered ecosystem, including its species richness and ecological processes such as community assembly.},

  abstract = {BackgroundOne of the most crucial steps in high-throughput sequence-based microbiome studies is the taxonomic assignment of sequences belonging to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Without taxonomic classification, functional and biological information of microbial communities cannot be inferred or interpreted. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA is the conventional marker region for fungal community studies. While bioinformatics pipelines that cluster reads into OTUs have received much attention in the literature, less attention has been given to the taxonomic classification of these sequences, upon which biological inference is dependent.ResultsHere we compare how three common fungal OTU taxonomic assignment tools (RDP Classifier, UTAX, and SINTAX) handle ITS fungal sequence data. The classification power, defined as the proportion of assigned OTUs at a given taxonomic rank, varied among the classifiers. Classifiers were generally consistent (assignment of the same taxonomy to a given OTU) across datasets and ranks; a small number of OTUs were assigned unique classifications across programs. We developed CONSTAX (CONSensus TAXonomy), a Python tool that compares taxonomic classifications of the three programs and merges them into an improved consensus taxonomy. This tool also produces summary classification outputs that are useful for downstream analyses.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that independent taxonomy assignment tools classify unique members of the fungal community, and greater classification power is realized by generating consensus taxonomy of available classifiers with CONSTAX.},

Macro- and micromorphological analyses of colony and fruit-body characters presented here confirmed that these three phylogenetic species correspond to two known species, S. iowensis and S. stellatus, and a newly discovered species. In addition, an expanded gene genealogical analysis is presented for the three species. The new species, named Sphaerobolus ingoldii Geml, Davis et Geiser, is described based on both molecular and morphological data. In addition, while S. iowensis previously had been reported in only two localities, we found that it is as common as or more common than S. stellatus in North America. Despite the considerable amount of DNA polymorhism found in all species, nested clade analyses of S. iowensis and S. stellatus indicated little phylogeographic structure in either species, perhaps due to heavy movement mediated by human activities.},

  abstract = {Old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii forests produce complex environmental and spatial gradients along which biota assemble. Given this, it has been proposed that changes in the crown microenvironment are associated with different community assembly outcomes for needle fungi. Using high-throughput sequencing, the endophytic mycobiomes of needles were characterized for increasing ages of needles sampled along the boles of eight coastal Douglas-fir trees. Leveraging airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to create three-dimensional ``point cloud'' representations of tree crowns revealed that crown closure accounted for more fungal compositional variation than height in crown, and fungal richness and diversity were positively correlated with increasing crown closure. Supplementing the point clouds of each climbed tree with clouds from {$>$}5,000 randomly selected trees in the study area showed that fungal communities from closed portions of the crown were increasingly structured with needle age. These findings highlight the importance of the crown microenvironment in the development of foliar fungal communities for a foundation tree species.},

  abstract = {Darwin's conviction that all living beings on Earth are related and the graph of relatedness is tree-shaped has been essentially confirmed by phylogenetic reconstruction first from morphology and later from data obtained by molecular sequencing. Limitations of the phylogenetic tree concept were recognized as more and more sequence information became available. The other path-breaking idea of Darwin, natural selection of fitter variants in populations, is cast into simple mathematical form and extended to mutation-selection dynamics. In this form the theory is directly applicable to RNA evolution in vitro and to virus evolution. Phylogeny and population dynamics of RNA provide complementary insights into evolution and the interplay between the two concepts will be pursued throughout this chapter. The two strategies for understanding evolution are ultimately related through the central paradigm of structural biology: sequence {$\Rightarrow$} structure {$\Rightarrow$} function. We elaborate on the state of the art in modeling both phylogeny and evolution of RNA driven by reproduction and mutation. Thereby the focus will be laid on models for phylogenetic sequence evolution as well as evolution and design of RNA structures with selected examples and notes on simulation methods. In the perspectives an attempt is made to combine molecular structure, population dynamics, and phylogeny in modeling evolution.},

  abstract = {Fourteen strains of aquatic hyphomycete species that are common on decaying leaves in running waters were grown in liquid culture and analyzed for total ergosterol contents. Media included an aqueous extract from senescent alder leaves, a malt extract broth, and a glucose-mineral salt solution. Concentrations of ergosterol in fungal mycelium ranged from 2.3 to 11.5 mg/g of dry mass. The overall average was 5.5 mg/g. Differences among both species and growth media were highly significant but followed no systematic pattern. Stationary-phase mycelium had ergosterol contents 10 to 12\% lower or higher than mycelium harvested during the growth phase, but these differences were only significant for one of four species examined. Availability of plant sterols in the growth medium had no clear effect on ergosterol concentrations in two species tested. To convert ergosterol contents determined in field samples to biomass values of aquatic hyphomycetes, a general multiplicative factor of 182 is proposed. More accurate estimates would be obtained with species-specific factors. Using these in combination with estimates of the proportion of the dominant species in a naturally established community on leaves resulted in biomass estimates that were typically 20\% lower than those obtained with the general conversion factor. Improvements of estimates with species-specific factors may be limited, however, by intraspecific variability in fungal ergosterol content.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligate biotrophs (Glomeromycota), which live symbiotically in the roots of most land plants and facilitate mineral nutrition of their hosts. Their spores are able to germinate in the absence of host-derived signals, but are unable to complete the life cycle without establishing a functional symbiosis with a host plant. Such behaviour did not represent a selective disadvantage, as a result of diverse survival strategies allowing them to compensate for the lack of host-regulated germination and to overcome their obligate biotrophic state. The ability to form hyphal fusions (anastomoses) between compatible mycelia may represent an important mechanism evolved by AMF to increase their chances of survival, since fungal germlings can plug into pre-existing extraradical mycelial networks, thus gaining immediate access to plant-derived carbon before asymbiotic growth arrest. In fusions between hyphae of the same or different individual germlings of the same isolate, perfect anastomoses occur with the highest frequency and are characterized by protoplasm continuity and complete fusion of hyphal walls. High anastomosis frequencies are also detected between extraradical mycelial networks produced by the same isolate, spreading from plants of different species, genera and families. Pre- and post-fusion incompatibility are often observed in hyphal interactions between asymbiotic and symbiotic mycelium and between genetically different germlings belonging to the same isolate, while pre-fusion incompatible responses, hindering hyphal fusions, occur between germlings of geographically different isolates. The analysis of vegetative compatibility/incompatibility during hyphal fusions represents a valuable tool for genetic studies of AMF, which are recalcitrant to axenic cultivation. Molecular analyses of the progeny of mycelium derived from nonself vegetative fusions of genetically different germlings of R. irregularis showed that genetic exchange occurs, despite low anastomosis frequencies and post-fusion incompatible responses, suggesting that anastomosis between genetically different mycelia may represent a recombination mechanism in the absence of an evident sexual cycle.},

  abstract = {The composition of the active microbial (bacterial and fungal) soil community in an arable wheat field subjected to different management practices was examined at five times during a 1-year period. Field sections were fertilized either at good agricultural practice (GAP) levels or at reduced levels (0.5{\texttimes} GAP) and were inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) at the same time. Field subsections were treated either with or without pesticides. Changes in the active microbial communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of reverse transcription-PCR-amplified 16S and 18S rRNA. Microbial community structure was primarily determined by season, and the seasonal trends were similar for the fungal and bacterial components. Between-sample microbial heterogeneity decreased under a mature crop in the summer but increased following harvesting and plowing. Although similar overall trends were seen for the two microbial components, sample variability was greater for the fungal community than for the bacterial community. The greatest management effects were due to GAP fertilization, which caused increases in the bacterial numbers in the total and culturable communities. Microbial biomass similarly increased. GAP fertilization also caused large shifts in both the active bacterial community structure and the active fungal community structure and additionally resulted in a decrease in the heterogeneity of the active bacterial community. Pesticide addition did not significantly affect bacterial numbers or heterogeneity, but it led to major shifts in the active soil bacterial community structure. PCR primers specific for Glomales 25S rRNA genes were used to monitor the VAM population following inoculation. Glomales were detected initially only in VAM-inoculated field sections but were subsequently detected in noninoculated field sections as the season progressed. After plowing, the level of Glomales was reduced in noninoculated field sections but remained high in VAM-inoculated field sections. Inoculation of VAM correlated with elevated soil phosphate and carbon levels.},

While TEs have been proposed to provide some beneficial functions to their hosts, e.g., by promoting genetic diversity and accelerating adaptive evolution (2 -- 5), their overall impact is considered deleterious (6). Insertional mutagenesis, gene misexpression, and genome instability represent some well-known examples of the deleterious effects associated with TEs. Importantly, by being able to move between vertical genetic lineages, TEs can still proliferate in a population of sexually reproducing individuals despite causing substantial fitness defects (6).},

  abstract = {Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97\% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r {$>$} 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs. IMPORTANCE Microbial ecologists have made exceptional improvements in our understanding of microbiomes in the last decade due to breakthroughs in sequencing technologies. These advances have wide-ranging implications for fields ranging from agriculture to human health. Due to limitations in databases, the majority of microbial ecology studies use a binning approach to approximate taxonomy based on DNA sequence similarity. There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches.},

There is molecular and structural evidence that the aquatic phycomycetes is a diverse, polyphyletic assemblage of species. For many years little research has been conducted with the aquatic phycomycetes, possibly because they were thought to be ecologically and commercially insignificant, but this perception has recently changed. Many of these species have been found to play key roles in biomass conversion in food webs (Fig. 1) and in the carbon cycle (2).},

  abstract = {An tree-inventory of Isoberlinia natural mixed stands was carried out in the tree-savannas and woodlands of the Wari--Maro Forest Reserve (Republic of Benin) to serve as basis to improve existing management strategies. Measurements were done in 96 rectangular plots of 30{\texttimes}50~m with a cumulative area of 14.4~ha. The two vegetation types were mainly distinguished by the overall tree-density (225.2~stems/ha in tree-savannah against 202.8~stems/ha in woodland), the overall mean height of the stands (13.1 and 14.6~m, respectively) and the mean height of Isoberlinia trees (14.1 and 16.8~m respectively). The other parameters (mean diameter, basal area, basal area contribution of Isoberlinia trees, bark thickness, tree-density of Isoberlinia trees as well as the Shannon diversity index and Pielou evenness index) had essentially the same values for the two vegetation types. The stem diameter structure of Isoberlinia stands in the two vegetation types had an ``inverse-J'' shape for the whole stand and the ``I'' shape for Isoberlinia trees. The stem diameter of Isoberlinia decreased on average 1.9~cm/m tree-height. Isoberlinia seedlings were more abundant below the canopy of mature trees than further away. The main dispersal mode of the species consisted of dropping the seeds from pods under the mother tree, and suckering which resulted in the observed aggregated distribution of the trees. These results were used to propose management strategies for the two vegetation types.},

  abstract = {SILVA (lat. forest) is a comprehensive web resource, providing services around up to date, high-quality datasets of aligned ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota domains. SILVA dates back to the year 1991 when Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig from the Technical University Munich started the integrated software workbench ARB (lat. tree) to support high-quality phylogenetic inference and taxonomy based on the SSU and LSU rDNA marker genes. At that time, the ARB project maintained both, the sequence reference datasets and the software package for data analysis. In 2005, with the massive increase of DNA sequence data, the maintenance of the software system ARB and the corresponding rRNA databases SILVA was split between Munich and the Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Group in Bremen. ARB has been continuously developed to include new features and improve the usability of the workbench. Thousands of users worldwide appreciate the seamless integration of common analysis tools under a central graphical user interface, in combination with its versatility. The first SILVA release was deployed in February 2007 based on the EMBL-EBI/ENA release 89. Since then, full SILVA releases offering the database content in various flavours are published at least annually, complemented by intermediate web-releases where only the SILVA web dataset is updated. SILVA is the only rDNA database project worldwide where special emphasis is given to the consistent naming of clades of uncultivated (environmental) sequences, where no validly described cultivated representatives are available. Also exclusive for SILVA is the maintenance of both comprehensive aligned 16S/18S rDNA and 23S/28S rDNA sequence datasets. Furthermore, the SILVA alignments and trees were designed to include Eukaryota, another unique feature among rDNA databases. With the termination of the European Ribosomal RNA Database Project in 2007, the SILVA database has become the authoritative rDNA database project for Europe. The application spectrum of ARB and SILVA ranges from biodiversity analysis, medical diagnostics, to biotechnology and quality control for academia and industry.},

The low-rank structure in the coefficient matrix is of intrinsic multivariate nature, which, when combined with sparsity, can further lift dimension reduction, conduct variable selection, and facilitate model interpretation. Using a Bayesian approach, we develop a unified sparse and low-rank multivariate regression method to both estimate the coefficient matrix and obtain its credible region for making inference. The newly developed sparse and low-rank prior for the coefficient matrix enables rank reduction, predictor selection and response selection simultaneously. We utilize the marginal likelihood to determine the regularization hyperparameter, so our method maximizes its posterior probability given the data. For theoretical aspect, the posterior consistency is established to discuss an asymptotic behavior of the proposed method. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated via simulation studies and a real application on yeast cell cycle data.},

Recent studies have examined the structure of mushroom-inhabiting bacterial (MIB) communities and their association with local environmental variables, but global-scale diversity and determinants of these communities remain poorly understood. Here we examined the MIB global diversity and community composition in relation to climate, soil and host factors. We found a core global mushroom microbiome, accounting for 30\% of sequence reads, while comprising a few bacterial genera such as Halomonas, Serratia, Bacillus, Cutibacterium, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia. Our analysis further revealed an important role of host phylogeny in shaping the communities of MIB, whereas the effects of climate and soil factors remained negligible. The results suggest that the communities of MIB and free-living bacteria are structured by contrasting community assembly processes and that fungal--bacterial interactions are an important determinant of MIB community structure.},

  abstract = {Summary The relative degree to which organisms move is a process operating at multiple temporal and physical scales (1). In recent years dispersal has received a great deal of attention in fields ranging from mathematics and physics to ecology and molecular biology, but only a patchy framework exists to explain dispersal over very large distances. Modeling patterns of long-distance dispersal (LDD) among macroorganisms, ranging from vertebrates and flying insects to seed plants, appears tractable, but documenting the geographic distributions and dispersal dynamics of microscopic propagules and microbes presents multiple theoretical and methodological challenges (2 -- 4). The majority of empirical research directly measuring the dispersal of microbes or microscopic propagules is restricted to relatively short distances, and tracking dispersal at greater spatial scales involves mathematical or genetic models, e.g., in studies of moss (5 -- 9), ferns (10 -- 13), bacteria (14 -- 19), and fungi (19 -- 23). However, fitting dispersal data (e.g., from the tracking of spore movement) to mathematical functions often over- or underestimates LDD and imprecisely describes the trajectory of spore movement across large distances (24 -- 28). Inferences based on population genetics data capture rare instances of successful LDD but incompletely describe underlying demographic processes and typically cannot speak to mechanisms of LDD (1). Besides the limitations of mathematical and genetic methods, important details about the natural history of species are often ignored or remain unknown, leaving many questions unanswered, including, e.g., how ephemeral propagules remain viable while exposed to harsh environments over extended periods of time.},

  abstract = {Fungal communities have been shown to be highly sensitive toward shifts in plant diversity and species composition in forest ecosystems. However, little is known about the impact of forest management on fungal diversity and community composition of geographically separated sites. This study examined the effects of four different forest management types on soil fungal communities. These forest management types include age class forests of young managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), with beech stands age of approximately 30 years, age class beech stands with an age of approximately 70 years, unmanaged beech stands, and coniferous stands dominated by either pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or spruce (Picea abies Karst.) which are located in three study sites across Germany. Soil were sampled from 48 study plots and we employed fungal ITS rDNA pyrotag sequencing to assess the soil fungal diversity and community structure. We found that forest management type significantly affects the Shannon diversity of soil fungi and a significant interaction effect of study site and forest management on the fungal operational taxonomic units richness. Consequently distinct fungal communities were detected in the three study sites and within the four forest management types, which were mainly related to the main tree species. Further analysis of the contribution of soil properties revealed that C/N ratio being the most important factor in all the three study sites whereas soil pH was significantly related to the fungal community in two study sites. Functional assignment of the fungal communities indicated that 38\% of the observed communities were Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and their distribution is significantly influenced by the forest management. Soil pH and C/N ratio were found to be the main drivers of the ECM fungal community composition. Additional fungal community similarity analysis revealed the presence of study site and management type specific ECM genera. This study extends our knowledge on the impact of forest management type on general and ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure in temperate forests. High plasticity across management types but also study site specific spatial distribution revealed new insights in the ECM fungal distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Obtaining a well supported schema of phylogenetic relationships among the major groups of living organisms requires considering as much taxonomic diversity as possible, but the computational cost of calculating large phylogenies has so far been a major obstacle. We show here that the parsimony algorithms implemented in TNT can successfully process the largest phylogenetic data set ever analysed, consisting of molecular sequences and morphology for 73 060 eukaryotic taxa. The trees resulting from molecules alone display a high degree of congruence with the major taxonomic groups, with a small proportion of misplaced species; the combined data set retrieves these groups with even higher congruence. This shows that tree-calculation algorithms effectively retrieve phylogenetic history for very large data sets, and at the same time provides strong corroboration for the major eukaryotic lineages long recognized by taxonomists.},

  abstract = {Version 1.5 of the computer program TNT completely integrates landmark data into phylogenetic analysis. Landmark data consist of coordinates (in two or three dimensions) for the terminal taxa; TNT reconstructs shapes for the internal nodes such that the difference between ancestor and descendant shapes for all tree branches sums up to a minimum; this sum is used as tree score. Landmark data can be analysed alone or in combination with standard characters; all the applicable commands and options in TNT can be used transparently after reading a landmark data set. The program continues implementing all the types of analyses in former versions, including discrete and continuous characters (which can now be read at any scale, and automatically rescaled by TNT). Using algorithms described in this paper, searches for landmark data can be made tens to hundreds of times faster than it was possible before (from T to 3T times faster, where T is the number of taxa), thus making phylogenetic analysis of landmarks feasible even on standard personal computers.},

The new interface is based on the GIMP Tool Kit, GTK (version 3). Formerly, only Windows versions of TNT had a GUI. The new interface improves upon the existing Windows GUI in several respects. These changes, together with several additions to the program since the publication of version 1.5, warrant a change in minor version, thus moving from version 1.5 to 1.6. Among the most notable improvements are the possibility to access graphical user dialogs by means of simple commands, to easily save trees in SVG format (``Scalable Vector Graphics'') directly from any tree-diagram being displayed, and to manage analyses in parallel (using multiple processors, by means of the PVM system or ``Parallel Virtual Machine''), as well as a generally more stable and consistent behaviour. As the binaries for the new version are compiled as native 64-bit applications, this removes the limitations for accessing large amounts of memory in the previous GUI Windows interface (which is a 32-bit application).},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding has emerged as a robust method for understanding biodiversity patterns by retrieving environmental DNA (eDNA) directly from ecosystems. Its low cost and accessibility have extended its use across biological topics, from symbiosis to biogeography, and ecology. A successful metabarcoding application depends on accurate and comprehensive reference databases for proper taxonomic assignment. The 18S rRNA gene is the primary genetic marker used for general/broad eukaryotic metabarcoding due to its combination of conserved and hypervariable regions, and the availability of extensive taxonomically-informed reference databases like PR2 and SILVA. Despite its advantages, 18S rRNA has certain limitations at lower taxonomic levels, depending on the lineage. Alternative fast-evolving molecular markers, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, have been adopted as widely used "barcoding genes" for eukaryotes due to their resolution to the species level. However, the COI gene lacks a curated taxonomically-informed database covering all eukaryotes, including protists, comparable to those available for 18S rRNA. To address this gap, we introduce eKOI, a curated COI gene database aimed at enhancing the taxonomic annotation and primer design for COI-based metabarcoding at the community level. This database integrates COI gene data from GenBank and mitochondrial genomes that are publicly available, followed by rigorous manual curation to eliminate redundancies and contaminants and to correct taxonomic annotations. We validate using the eKOI database for taxonomic annotation of protists by re-annotating several COI-based metabarcoding studies, revealing previously unidentified biodiversity. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the accuracy of the taxonomic annotations, highlighting the potential of eKOI to uncover new biodiversity in various eukaryotic lineages.},

The wall is much more than the outer layer of the fungus; it is also a dynamic organelle whose composition greatly influences the ecology of the fungus and whose composition is highly regulated in response to environmental conditions and imposed stresses. A measure of the importance of the cell wall can be appreciated by the fact that approximately one-fifth of the yeast genome is devoted to the biosynthesis of the cell wall (1, 2). Of these approximately 1,200 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes (2), some are concerned with the assembly of the basic components, others provide substrates for wall materials, and many regulate the assembly process and couple this to environmental challenges. They include genes that encode carbohydrate active enzymes (which can be found in the CAZy database [http://www.cazy.org]) (3) and include multigene families of chitin and glucan synthases as well as remodeling enzymes such as the glycohydrolases (glucanases, chitinases) and transglycosidases. Many of the building blocks of the cell wall are conserved in different fungal species (4), while other components of the wall are species-specific, and there is perhaps no part of the cell that exhibits more phenotypic diversity and plasticity than the cell wall.},

RNAlater (Ambion) was shown to stabilize RNA in environmental samples for periods of at least 3 months at -20{$^\circ$}C. Protocols for library construction were established on total RNA extracted from Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites. The methodology was then used on algal mats from geothermal hot springs in Tengchong county, Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, and activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. The Tenchong libraries were dominated by RNA from prokaryotes, reflecting the mainly prokaryote microbial composition. The majority of these clones resulted from rRNA; only a few appeared to be derived from mRNA. In contrast, many clones from the activated sludge library had significant similarity to eukaryote mRNA-encoded protein sequences. A library was also made using polyadenylated RNA isolated from total RNA from activated sludge; many more clones in this library were related to eukaryotic mRNA sequences and proteins. Open reading frames (ORFs) up to 378 amino acids in size could be identified. Some resembled known proteins over their full length, e.g., 36\% match to cystatin, 49\% match to ribosomal protein L32, 63\% match to ribosomal protein S16, 70\% to CPC2 protein. The methodology described here permits the polyadenylated transcriptome to be isolated from environmental samples with no knowledge of the identity of the microorganisms in the sample or the necessity to culture them. It has many uses, including the identification of novel eukaryotic ORFs encoding proteins and enzymes.},

  abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is sensitive to mismatches between primer and template, and mismatches can lead to inefficient amplification of targeted regions of DNA template. In PCRs in which a degenerate primer pool is employed, each primer can behave differently. Therefore, inefficiencies due to different primer melting temperatures within a degenerate primer pool, in addition to mismatches between primer binding sites and primers, can lead to a distortion of the true relative abundance of targets in the original DNA pool. A theoretical analysis indicated that a combination of primer-template and primer-amplicon interactions during PCR cycles 3-12 is potentially responsible for this distortion. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel amplification strategy, entitled "Polymerase-exonuclease (PEX) PCR", in which primer-template interactions and primer-amplicon interactions are separated. The PEX PCR method substantially and significantly improved the evenness of recovery of sequences from a mock community of known composition, and allowed for amplification of templates with introduced mismatches near the 3' end of the primer annealing sites. When the PEX PCR method was applied to genomic DNA extracted from complex environmental samples, a significant shift in the observed microbial community was detected. Furthermore, the PEX PCR method provides a mechanism to identify which primers in a primer pool are annealing to target gDNA. Primer utilization patterns revealed that at high annealing temperatures in the PEX PCR method, perfect match annealing predominates, while at lower annealing temperatures, primers with up to four mismatches with templates can contribute substantially to amplification. The PEX PCR method is simple to perform, is limited to PCR mixes and a single exonuclease step which can be performed without reaction cleanup, and is recommended for reactions in which degenerate primer pools are used or when mismatches between primers and template are possible.},

Secondary values are defined as the outputs, life-support functions and services, generated by wetlands. Methods for measuring these values are discussed.

The PacBio protocol for preparation of sequencing templates employs blunt-end hairpin adapter ligation, which enables a short turnaround time for sequence production. However, we have found a significant portion of sequencing yield contains chimeric reads resulting from blunt-end ligation of multiple template molecules to each other prior to adapter ligation. These artefactual fusion DNA sequences pose a major challenge to analysis and can lead to false-positive detection of fusion events. We assessed the frequency of artefactual fusion when using blunt-end adapter ligation and compared it to an alternative method using A/T overhang adapter ligation. The A/T overhang adapter ligation method showed a vast improvement in limiting artefactual fusion events and is now our recommended procedure for adapter ligation during PacBio library preparation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Fungi are more important to our lives than is assumed by the general public. They can comprise both devastating pathogens and plant-associated mutualists in nature, and several species have also become important workhorses of biotechnology. Fungal diversity research has in a short time transcended from a low-tech research area to a method-intensive high-tech discipline. With the advent of the new genomic and post-genomic methodologies, large quantities of new fungal data are currently becoming available each year. Whilst these new data and methodologies may help modern fungal diversity researchers to explore and discover the yet hidden diversity within a context of biological processes and organismal diversity, they need to be reconciled with the traditional approaches. Such a synthesis is actually difficult to accomplish given the current discouraging situation of fungal biology education, especially in the areas of biodiversity and taxonomic research. The number of fungal diversity researchers and taxonomists in academic institutions is decreasing, as are opportunities for mycological education in international curricula. How can we educate and stimulate students to pursue a career in fungal diversity research and taxonomy and avoid the situation whereby only those few institutions with strong financial support are able to conduct excellent research? Our short answer is that we need a combination of increased specialization and increased collaboration, i.e. that scientists with specialized expertise (e.g., in data generation, compilation, interpretation, and communication) consistently work together to generate and deliver new fungal knowledge in a more integrative manner -- closing the gap between both traditional and modern approaches and academic and non-academic environments. Here we discuss how this perspective could be implemented in the training of the `next generation fungal diversity researcher'.},

  abstract = {Summary Lichens were generally accepted as an independent group of organisms when Schwendener (1) discovered that they are the result of the association of fungi and algae. This insight was not widely accepted by contemporaries but initiated a scientific revolution as lichens later became the prime example of a mutualistic symbiosis and, indeed, the phenomenon for which the term symbiosis was originally introduced in biology as ``symbiotismus'' (2 , 3). The lichen symbiosis has proved to be one of the most important lifestyles in the Ascomycota and is also known from a few Basidiomycota. Approximately 20,000 currently known fungal species live as lichens, mostly in species-rich lineages of Ascomycota (4). The traditional view of lichens as a mutualistic symbiosis of a fungus and one or several green algae or cyanobacteria has always been debated (5), but it has recently been challenged more than ever by the discovery of numerous additional microorganisms that potentially occur as obligatory participants in the symbiosis.},

  abstract = {The basidiomycete mushroom Hebeloma cylindrosporum is a frequently found pioneer ectomycorrhizal species naturally associated with Pinus pinaster trees growing in coastal sand dune ecosystems along the Atlantic south-west coast of France. The genotypic diversity and spatial structure of three populations of this fungal species have been studied. At each site the basidiocarps were mapped, sampled and propagated as pure mycelial cultures. For each of the isolates, we have studied polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome, polymorphisms at two different nuclear loci and also fingerprints produced with a multicopy DNA probe. The comparison of the different polymorphisms obtained, with each of the four molecular methods used, allowed the identification of several of the different genets present in each site. In two of the studied sites most of the basidiocarps, which often occurred as dense patches of 10--30 in 1 m2 or less, were of a unique genotype, suggesting the below-ground mycelia to be of a small size (from 50 cm2 to approx. 7 m2 for the larger mycelia) and that the root system of a single Pinus tree can host several genets of the same symbiotic fungus. In the two sites, which were studied again after a 3-year interval, none of the genotypes identified in the first year of sampling was re-identified 3 years later. These results contrast with those reported for other species of soilborne homobasidiomycete species, either ectomycorrhizal, parasitic or saprophytic, showing mostly large clones resulting from the vegetative growth and from persistence of below-ground mycelia. Sexual reproduction through meiospore dispersal seems to play a key role in the structuring of the populations of H. cylindrosporum. Mycelia associated with the root systems seem to be replaced after 1 or a few years, during which basidiocarp differentiation takes place. As opposed to the few other studied ectomycorrhizal species, H. cylindrosporum has the characteristics of ruderal species, with a short life-span adapted to pioneer situations, e.g. to nutrient-poor and unstable sandy soils of coastal sand dunes.},

The balance between these two reproductive modes affects establishment dynamics, and ultimately the evolutionary potential of populations. The pattern of colonization was studied in two species of ectomycorrhizal fungi: Tricholoma populinum and Tricholoma scalpturatum. The former is considered to be a host specialist whereas T. scalpturatum is a generalist taxon. Fruit bodies of both basidiomycete species were mapped and collected over several years from a black poplar (Populus nigra) stand, at two different sites. Multilocus genotypes (= genets) were identified based on the analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) patterns and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (rDNA IGS). The genetic analyses revealed differences in local population dynamics between the two species. Tricholoma scalpturatum tended to capture new space through sexual spores whereas T. populinum did this by clonal growth, suggesting trade-offs in allocation of resources at the genet level. Genet numbers and sizes strongly differ between the two study sites, perhaps as a result of abiotic disturbance on mycelial establishment and genet behaviour.},

A great deal must, however, still be done to promote the AMA under African mycologists, and those elsewhere with interests in Africa. African mycologists also experience challenges typical of the developing world and a great deal of fungi still needs to be discovered. This can also be seen as representing great opportunities for research and collaboration. Several issues pertinent to mycology in Africa were discussed during Special Interest Group sessions of the 9th International Mycological Congress in 2010, and through several opinion pieces contributed by AMA members in the AMA newsletter, MycoAfrica. This contribution serves as a document to summarise these in a form that can be presented to fellow mycologists, biologists and other scientists, relevant government departments, funding bodies and Non-Governmental Organizations and that pins down the importance of mycology, the status thereof in Africa and the need to promote it more.},

However, these databases are largely incomplete in terms of taxon coverage, and a significant effort is required from herbaria and living fungal collections for the mass-barcoding of well-identified and well-curated fungal specimens or strains. Here, a PacBio amplicon sequencing approach is applied to recent lichen herbarium specimens for the sequencing of the fungal ITS barcode, allowing a higher throughput sample processing than Sanger sequencing, which often required the use of cloning. Out of 96 multiplexed samples, a full-length ITS sequence of the target lichenised fungal species was recovered for 85 specimens. In addition, sequences obtained for co-amplified fungi gave an interesting insight into the diversity of endolichenic fungi. Challenges encountered at both the laboratory and bioinformatic stages are discussed, and cost and quality are compared with Sanger sequencing. With increasing data output and reducing sequencing cost, PacBio amplicon sequencing is seen as a promising approach for the generation of reference sequences for lichenised fungi as well as the characterisation of lichen-associated fungal communities.

The database mainly consists of nuclear-encoded protistan sequences. However, metazoans, land plants, macrosporic fungi and eukaryotic organelles (mitochondrion, plastid and others) are also included because they are useful for the analysis of high-troughput sequencing data sets. Introns and putative chimeric sequences have been also carefully checked. Taxonomic assignation of sequences consists of eight unique taxonomic fields. In total, 136 866 sequences are nuclear encoded, 45 708 (36 501 mitochondrial and 9657 chloroplastic) are from organelles, the remaining being putative chimeric sequences. The website allows the users to download sequences from the entire and partial databases (including representative sequences after clustering at a given level of similarity). Different web tools also allow searches by sequence similarity. The presence of both rRNA and rDNA sequences, taking into account introns (crucial for eukaryotic sequences), a normalized eight terms ranked-taxonomy and updates of new GenBank releases were made possible by a long-term collaboration between experts in taxonomy and computer scientists.},

  abstract = {Declining Wild Mushroom Recognition and Usage in Burkina Faso. Ethnomycological investigation was carried out in Burkina Faso, West Africa, using standardized interviews focused on 40 representative mushroom species assembled in a traveling herbarium (photographs plus preserved specimens). A total of 540 informants from 18 localities representing three main ethnic groups---M{\`o}os{\'e}, Bobo, and Gouin---were interviewed, though the bulk of those interviewed were M{\`o}os{\'e} (or Mossi) from the more populous central region of the country. Among the study species, as many as 24 were considered edible by the different ethnic groups; a few medicinal uses also were noted. The edibility of a common Chlorophyllum species is confirmed for the three ethnic groups. Mushroom nomenclature is not well developed in any of the three groups as evidenced by the fact that many mushrooms, including some common edible species, do not appear to have specific local names, but are instead simply referred to by a general term for ``mushroom.'' Preliminary observations about inter--ethnic variation in recognition, naming, and appreciation of mushrooms are noted. Older people recognized many more mushroom species than did younger people, and women appeared to be slightly more knowledgeable about mushrooms than men. The most important finding is that the gathering and consumption of wild edible mushrooms seems to be dying out in Burkina Faso, especially in the central part of the country, apparently because of declining mushroom populations resulting from disappearing forest habitats.},

  abstract = {Background: 2b-RAD (type IIB endonucleases restriction-site associated DNA) approach was invented by Wang in 2012 and proven as a simple and flexible method for genome-wide genotyping. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement for the existent 2b-RAD approach. Firstly, it doesn't include the samples pooling in library preparation as other reduced representation libraries. Secondly, the information of 2b-RAD tags, such as tags numbers and distributions, in most of species are unknown. The purposes of the research are to improve a new 2b-RAD approach which possesses samples pooling, moreover to figure out the characteristic and application potentiality of 2b-RAD tags by bioinformatics analysis. Results: Twelve adapter1 and an adapter2 were designed. A library approach comprising digestion, ligation, pooling, PCR and size selection were established. For saving costs, we used non-phosphorylated adapters and indexed PCR primers. A F2 population of rice (Oryza sativa .L) was genotyped to validate the new approach. On average, 2000332 high quality reads of each sample were obtained with high evenness. Totally 3598 markers containing 3804 SNPs were discovered and the missing rate was 18.9\%. A genetic linkage map of 1385 markers was constructed and 92\% of the markers' orders in the genetic map were in accordance with the orders in chromosomes. Meanwhile, the bioinformatics simulation in 20 species showed that the BsaXI had the most widespread recognition sites, indicating that 2b-RAD tags had a powerful application potentiality for high density genetic map. Using modified adapters with a fix base in 3{$\prime$}end, 2b-RAD was also fit for QTL studies with low costs. Conclusions: An improved 2b-RAD genotyping approach was established in this research and named as I2b-RAD. The method was a simple, fast, cost-effective and multiplex sequencing library approach. It could be adjusted by selecting different enzymes and adapters to fit for alternative uses including chromosomes assembly, QTL fine mapping and even natural population analysis.},

  abstract = {BAli-Phy, a popular Bayesian method that co-estimates multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, is a rigorous statistical method, but due to its computational requirements, it has generally been limited to relatively small datasets (at most about 100 sequences). Here, we repurpose BAli-Phy as a `phylogeny-aware' alignment method: we estimate the phylogeny from the input of unaligned sequences, and then use that as a fixed tree within BAli-Phy.We show that this approach achieves high accuracy, greatly superior to Prank, the current most popular phylogeny-aware alignment method, and is even more accurate than MAFFT, one of the top performing alignment methods in common use. Furthermore, this approach can be used to align very large datasets (up to 1000 sequences in this study).See https://doi.org/10.13012/B2IDB-7863273\_V1 for datasets used in this study.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We first evaluate the minimum length for a MUM to be significant, and significant MUMs shared by two genomes are then searched with a linear time algorithm. Then, by simulating sets of sequences evolving according to a given tree topology, we prove that this distance varies monotonically with the amount of evolutionary events and, using the NJ method, we get phylogenetic trees very close to the initial ones. Finally, we apply this very fast method to compare bacterial genomes among the Gammaproteobacteria family.},

  abstract = {High throughput sequencing technology has great promise for biodiversity studies. However, an underlying assumption is that the primers used in these studies are universal for the prokaryotic or eukaryotic groups of interest. Full primer universality is difficult or impossible to achieve and studies using different primer sets make biodiversity comparisons problematic. The aim of this study was to design and optimize universal eukaryotic primers that could be used as a standard in future biodiversity studies. Using the alignment of all eukaryotic sequences from the publicly available SILVA database, we generated a full characterization of variable versus conserved regions in the 18S rRNA gene. All variable regions within this gene were analyzed and our results suggested that the V2, V4 and V9 regions were best suited for biodiversity assessments. Previously published universal eukaryotic primers as well as a number of self-designed primers were mapped to the alignment. Primer selection will depend on sequencing technology used, and this study focused on the 454 pyrosequencing GS FLX Titanium platform. The results generated a primer pair yielding theoretical matches to 80\% of the eukaryotic and 0\% of the prokaryotic sequences in the SILVA database. An empirical test of marine sediments using the AmpliconNoise pipeline for analysis of the high throughput sequencing data yielded amplification of sequences for 71\% of all eukaryotic phyla with no isolation of prokaryotic sequences. To our knowledge this is the first characterization of the complete 18S rRNA gene using all eukaryotes present in the SILVA database, providing a robust test for universal eukaryotic primers. Since both in silico and empirical tests using high throughput sequencing retained high inclusion of eukaryotic phyla and exclusion of prokaryotes, we conclude that these primers are well suited for assessing eukaryote diversity, and can be used as a standard in biodiversity studies.},

This paper is the 6th contribution in the FUSE series---presenting one new genus, twelve new species, twelve new country records, and three new combinations. The new genus is: Pseudozeugandromyces (Laboulbeniomycetes, Laboulbeniales). The new species are: Albatrellopsis flettioides from Pakistan, Aureoboletus garciae from Mexico, Entomophila canadense from Canada, E. frigidum from Sweden, E. porphyroleucum from Vietnam, Erythrophylloporus flammans from Vietnam, Marasmiellus boreoorientalis from Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, Marasmiellus longistipes from Pakistan, Pseudozeugandromyces tachypori on Tachyporus pusillus (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) from Belgium, Robillarda sohagensis from Egypt, Trechispora hondurensis from Honduras, and Tricholoma kenanii from Turkey. The new records are: Arthrorhynchus eucampsipodae on Eucampsipoda africanum (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Rwanda and South Africa, and on Nycteribia vexata (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Bulgaria; A. nycteribiae on Eucampsipoda africanum from South Africa, on Penicillidia conspicua (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Bulgaria (the first undoubtful country record), and on Penicillidia pachymela from Tanzania; Calvatia lilacina from Pakistan; Entoloma shangdongense from Pakistan; Erysiphe quercicola on Ziziphus jujuba (Rosales, Rhamnaceae) and E. urticae on Urtica dioica (Rosales, Urticaceae) from Pakistan; Fanniomyces ceratophorus on Fannia canicularis (Diptera, Faniidae) from the Netherlands; Marasmiellus biformis and M. subnuda from Pakistan; Morchella anatolica from Turkey; Ophiocordyceps ditmarii on Vespula vulgaris (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) from Austria; and Parvacoccum pini on Pinus cembra (Pinales, Pinaceae) from Austria. The new combinations are: Appendiculina gregaria, A. scaptomyzae, and Marasmiellus rodhallii. Analysis of an LSU dataset of Arthrorhynchus including isolates of A. eucampsipodae from Eucampsipoda africanum and Nycteribia spp. hosts, revealed that this taxon is a complex of multiple species segregated by host genus. Analysis of an SSU--LSU dataset of Laboulbeniomycetes sequences revealed support for the recognition of four monophyletic genera within Stigmatomyces sensu lato: Appendiculina, Fanniomyces, Gloeandromyces, and Stigmatomyces sensu stricto. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of Rhytismataceae based on ITS--LSU ribosomal DNA resulted in a close relationship of Parvacoccum pini with Coccomyces strobi.},

These applications have an enormous computational cost due to the large amount of genomic data they process. The first step in many of these applications consists in aligning DNA reads against a reference genome. Very recently, the wavefront alignment (WFA) algorithm has been introduced, significantly reducing the execution time of the read alignment process. This paper presents the first FPGA-based hardware/software co-designed accelerator of such relevant algorithm. Compared to the reference WFA CPU-only implementation, the proposed accelerator achieves performance speedups of up to 13.5{\texttimes} while consuming up to 14.6{\texttimes} less energy when aligning short reads. When aligning long reads, the proposed accelerator achieves speedups of up to 9.9{\texttimes} while consuming up to 10.9{\texttimes} less energy.},

To satisfy this need, analytical facilities must adopt protocols that can support the rapid, cost-effective assembly of barcodes. In this paper we discuss the prospects for establishing high volume DNA barcoding facilities by evaluating key steps in the analytical chain from specimens to barcodes. Alliances with members of the taxonomic community represent the most effective strategy for provisioning the analytical chain with specimens. The optimal protocols for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR amplification of the barcode region depend strongly on their condition, but production targets of 100K barcode records per year are now feasible for facilities working with compliant specimens. The analysis of museum collections is currently challenging, but PCR cocktails that combine polymerases with repair enzyme(s) promise future success. Barcode analysis is already a cost-effective option for species identification in some situations and this will increasingly be the case as reference libraries are assembled and analytical protocols are simplified.},

We have therefore compiled fruit body traits with their evidenced or suggested functions. Some traits have no immediate functional meaning, but many are suggestive of some ecological importance. Many traits serve more than one function, and traits interact in the sense of trade-offs, patterns that reflect the economy of fungal design. In conclusion, the review comes up with well and little-known mushroom properties, and the numerous gaps in attributing traits to functions.},

In this review, we compiled information about the adaptability of pileate basidiomycetes by illustrating their habits in contrasting biomes, the arctic regions and tropical lowland rainforests. Mushrooms are faced with differing stress factors and levels in the two ecozones. They fight such challenges by using, by and large, similar physiological and morphological toolkits. They make them fit for extreme environmental conditions, by expressing traits according to biome characteristics. This way, fungal assemblages are formed and pheno- and genotypic plasticity is capitalised. Still, many questions remain open and need further clarification, such as trade-offs between thermal protection and predator defence, prevailing dispersal modes in the main ecozones, interactions with animals and the mechanisms that create genetic plasticity.},

  abstract = {The cultivation of truffles in the Southern Hemisphere was conceived in New Zealand towards the end of the 1970s with practical research beginning in the mid-1980s. Within 2 years, methods had been developed for producing mycorrhized plants and establishing truffi{\`e}res both on soils with a naturally high pH and acidic soils to which large quantities of calcitic lime had been applied to raise the pH to the ideal. The first Tuber melanosporum truffles were found in 1993, and the first commercial harvest was made in 1997 on a truffi{\`e}re near Gisborne. The first commercial Tuber borchii truffles were harvested in April 2007 at West Melton near Christchurch, New Zealand.The New Zealand developments attracted attention in Australia in the early 1990s, and the first truffles were harvested in Tasmania in 1999. This and 150 \% tax write-offs stimulated the establishment of truffi{\`e}res throughout Australia which now has an industry at least 30 times the size of the New Zealand one. Chile established its first truffi{\`e}res in 2003 and produced its first T. melanosporum truffles in 2009. Financial assistance from the Chilean government has ensured the rapid expansion of truffi{\`e}res. Other Southern Hemisphere countries have also established truffi{\`e}res, but these have yet to produce. The issues surrounding the development of truffle farming in the Southern Hemisphere are fully discussed.},

  abstract = {Sutorius is described as a new genus of Boletaceae to accommodate Boletus robustus originally named illegitimately by C.C. Frost from eastern North America. The legitimate name, Boletus eximius, provided by C.H. Peck, has been used since for a dark purple to chocolate brown bolete with finely scaly stipe and reddish brown spore deposit. This iconic taxon has been documented on five continents. Despite the straightforward species identification from morphology, the interpretation of stipe macro-morphology and spore color has led to equivocal generic placement. Phylogenetic analyses of genes encoding large subunit rRNA and translation elongation factor 1{$\alpha$} confirm Sutorius as a unique generic lineage in the Boletaceae. Two species are recognized based on multiple accessions: S. eximius, represented by collections from North America, Costa Rica, Guyana, Indonesia and Japan (molecular data are lacking for only the Guyanan and Japanese material); and S. australiensis, represented by material from Queensland, Australia. Additional collections from Zambia and Thailand represent independent lineages, but sampling is insufficient to describe new species for these entities.},

Phylogenetic analyses of large-subunit rDNA and translation elongation factor 1{$\alpha$} confirmed Harrya as a unique generic lineage with two species, one of which is newly described (H. atriceps).

Multiple accessions from Queensland, Australia, support the synonymy of at least three species in a separate Australian clade in the new genus, Australopilus. The truffle-like Royoungia is also supported as a separate lineage in this clade of boletes. Even though it lacks stipe characters, it possesses the deep, bright yellow to orange pigments in the peridium. Additional collections from Zambia and Thailand represent independent lineages of uncertain phylogenetic placement in the Chromapes complex, but sampling is insufficient for formal description of new species.

  abstract = {Summary Microsporidia were initially described about 150 years ago with the identification of Nosema bombycis as the organism responsible for the disease p{\'e}brine in silkworms (1). Microsporidia are ubiquitous in the environment and infect almost all invertebrates and vertebrates, as well as some protists (2). Spores from microsporidia are commonly found in surface water (3). These organisms are eukaryotes that have a nucleus with a nuclear envelope, an intracytoplasmic membrane system, chromosome separation on mitotic spindles, vesicular Golgi, and a mitochondrial remnant organelle lacking a genome termed a mitosome (4). For insects, fish, laboratory rodents, and rabbits microsporidia are important pathogens, and they have been investigated as biological control agents for destructive species of insects (2). Several species of microsporidia have caused significant agricultural economic losses including Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae in honeybees (5), Loma salmonae in salmonid fish (6), and Thelohania species in shrimp (7). Franzen (8) published an excellent review of the history of research on these pathogens, and a recent textbook by Weiss and Becnel (2) provides a comprehensive examination of what is known about these organisms. In 1977 Sprague elevated the class or order Microsporidia to the phylum Microspora (9), and a decade later Sprague and Becnel (10) suggested that the term Microsporidia should instead be used for the phylum name. These organisms were previously considered ``primitive'' protozoa (11), but molecular phylogenetic analysis has resulted in the insight that these organisms are not primitive but instead are degenerate, and that Microsporidia are related to the Fungi, either as a basal branch of the Fungi or as a sister group (12 -- 16).},

However, high computational complexity of the Viterbi algorithm is a major concern. Accelerating the Viterbi algorithm is important, especially when the number of states or the length of the sequences increase significantly. In this paper, a parallel solution to improve the performance of Viterbi algorithm is presented. This is achieved by formulating a matrix product based algorithm. This algorithm has been mapped to a NVIDIA graphics processing unit. The performance for different parameters and realizations are compared. The results depicts matrix product is not a viable option for small number of states. However, matrix product solution using shared memory for large number of states gains good performance when compared with the serial version.},

  abstract = {Motivation: With the advancements of next-generation sequencing technology, it is now possible to study samples directly obtained from the environment. Particularly, 16S rRNA gene sequences have been frequently used to profile the diversity of organisms in a sample. However, such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their relative abundance in a sample.Results: To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian clustering method termed Clustering 16S rRNA for OTU Prediction (CROP). CROP can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cut-off threshold (3\%/5\%) as required by hierarchical clustering methods. By applying our method to several datasets, we demonstrate that CROP is robust against sequencing errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering methods.Availability and Implementation: Source code freely available at the following URL: http://code.google.com/p/crop-tingchenlab/, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux and MS Windows.Contact:tingchen@usc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes. Our research heightens interest in the global significance of the fungi and raises additional concerns about the sustainability of forests that depend on heavy precipitation.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Sequence databases are growing fast, challenging existing analysis pipelines. Reducing the redundancy of sequence databases by similarity clustering improves speed and sensitivity of iterative searches. But existing tools cannot efficiently cluster databases of the size of UniProt to 50\% maximum pairwise sequence identity or below. Furthermore, in metagenomics experiments typically large fractions of reads cannot be matched to any known sequence anymore because searching with sensitive but relatively slow tools (e.g. BLAST or HMMER3) through comprehensive databases such as UniProt is becoming too costly.Results: MMseqs (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite for fast and deep clustering and searching of large datasets, such as UniProt, or 6-frame translated metagenomics sequencing reads. MMseqs contains three core modules: a fast and sensitive prefiltering module that sums up the scores of similar k-mers between query and target sequences, an SSE2- and multi-core-parallelized local alignment module, and a clustering module.In our homology detection benchmarks, MMseqs is much more sensitive and 4--30 times faster than UBLAST and RAPsearch, respectively, although it does not reach BLAST sensitivity yet. Using its cascaded clustering workflow, MMseqs can cluster large databases down to {$\sim$}30\% sequence identity at hundreds of times the speed of BLASTclust and much deeper than CD-HIT and USEARCH. MMseqs can also update a database clustering in linear instead of quadratic time. Its much improved sensitivity-speed trade-off should make MMseqs attractive for a wide range of large-scale sequence analysis tasks.Availability and implementation: MMseqs is open-source software available under GPL at https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqsContact: ~martin.steinegger@mpibpc.mpg.de, soeding@mpibpc.mpg.deSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous alignment and secondary structure prediction of RNA sequences is often referred to as ``RNA structural alignment.'' A class of the methods for structural alignment is based on the principles proposed by Sankoff more than 25 years ago. The Sankoff algorithm simultaneously folds and aligns two or more sequences. The advantage of this algorithm over those that separate the folding and alignment steps is that it makes better predictions. The disadvantage is that it is slower and requires more computer memory to run. The amount of computational resources needed to run the Sankoff algorithm is so high that it took more than a decade before the first implementation of a Sankoff style algorithm was published. However, with the faster computers available today and the improved heuristics used in the implementations the Sankoff-based methods have become practical. This chapter describes the methods based on the Sankoff algorithm. All the practical implementations of the algorithm use heuristics to make them run in reasonable time and memory. These heuristics are also described in this chapter.},

Data emerging from tropical studies, and from large-scale sequencing of environmental samples, have the potential to contribute towards a more robust figure. Additional evidence of species richness is coming from long-term studies of particular non-tropical sites, and also from molecular phylogenetic studies revealing extensive cryptic speciation. However, uncertainties remain over fungus:plant species ratios and how they should be extrapolated to the global scale, and also as to the geographical distribution of fungi known only as sequences. Also unclear is the extent to which figures should be modified to allow for insect-associated fungi. The need for comprehensive studies, especially in the tropics, to address the uncertainties used in past extrapolations, is stressed. For the present, it is recommended that the phrase ``at least 1.5, but probably as many as 3 million'' be adopted for general use until some of the current uncertainties are resolved.},

To elucidate the mechanism of this type of endosymbiosis, we combined PacBio and Illumina sequencing to assemble a high-quality and near-complete macronuclear genome of P. bursaria. The genomic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses indicate that P. bursaria is the basal clade of the Paramecium genus. Through comparative genomic analyses with its close relatives, we found that P. bursaria encodes more genes related to nitrogen metabolism and mineral absorption, but encodes fewer genes involved in oxygen binding and N-glycan biosynthesis. A comparison of the transcriptomic profiles between P. bursaria with and without endosymbiotic Chlorella showed differential expression of a wide range of metabolic genes. We selected 32 most differentially expressed genes to perform RNA interference experiment in P. bursaria, and found that P. bursaria can regulate the abundance of their symbionts through glutamine supply. This study provides novel insights into Paramecium evolution and will extend our knowledge of the molecular mechanism for the induction of endosymbiosis between P. bursaria and green algae.},

  abstract = {Basidiomycota is one of the major phyla in the fungal tree of life. The outline of Basidiomycota provides essential taxonomic information for researchers and workers in mycology. In this study, we present a time-framed phylogenomic tree with 487 species of Basidiomycota from 127 families, 47 orders, 14 classes and four subphyla; we update the outline of Basidiomycota based on the phylogenomic relationships and the taxonomic studies since 2019; and we provide notes for each order and discuss the history, defining characteristics, evolution, justification of orders, problems, significance, and plates. Our phylogenomic analysis suggests that the subphyla diverged in a time range of 443--490 Myr (million years), classes in a time range of 312--412 Myr, and orders in a time range of 102--361 Myr. Families diverged in a time range of 50--289 Myr, 76--224 Myr, and 62--156 Myr in Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina, and Ustilaginomycotina, respectively. Based on the phylogenomic relationships and divergence times, we propose a new suborder Mycenineae in Agaricales to accommodate Mycenaceae. In the current outline of Basidiomycota, there are four subphyla, 20 classes, 77 orders, 297 families, and 2134 genera accepted. When building a robust taxonomy of Basidiomycota in the genomic era, the generation of molecular phylogenetic data has become relatively easier. Finding phenotypical characters, especially those that can be applied for identification and classification, however, has become increasingly challenging.},

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon `barcodes'. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low--density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species--level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost--effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.},

  abstract = {DNA barcoding is a fast and reliable tool to assess and monitor biodiversity and, via community phylogenetics, to investigate ecological and evolutionary processes that may be responsible for the community structure of forests. In this study, DNA barcodes for the two widely used plastid coding regions rbcL and matK are used to contribute to identification of morphologically undetermined individuals, as well as to investigate phylogenetic structure of tree communities in 70 subplots (10 {\texttimes} 10m) of a 25-ha forest-dynamics plot in Brunei (Borneo, Southeast Asia). The combined matrix (rbcL + matK) comprised 555 haplotypes (from {$\geq$}154 genera, 68 families and 25 orders sensu APG, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016), making a substantial contribution to tree barcode sequences from Southeast Asia. Barcode sequences were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using maximum likelihood, both with and without constraining the topology of taxonomic orders to match that proposed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. A third phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the program Phylomatic to investigate the influence of phylogenetic resolution on results. Detection of non-random patterns of community assembly was determined by net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI). In most cases, community assembly was either random or phylogenetically clustered, which likely indicates the importance to community structure of habitat filtering based on phylogenetically correlated traits in determining community structure. Different phylogenetic trees gave similar overall results, but the Phylomatic tree produced greater variation across plots for NRI and NTI values, presumably due to noise introduced by using an unresolved phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that using a DNA barcode tree has benefits over the traditionally used Phylomatic approach by increasing precision and accuracy and allowing the incorporation of taxonomically unidentified individuals into analyses.},

  abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is widely used to study prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial diversity. Technological constraints limit most studies to marker lengths below 600 base pairs (bp). Longer sequencing reads of several thousand bp are now possible with third-generation sequencing. Increased marker lengths provide greater taxonomic resolution and allow for phylogenetic methods of classification, but longer reads may be subject to higher rates of sequencing error and chimera formation. In addition, most bioinformatics tools for DNA metabarcoding were designed for short reads and are therefore unsuitable. Here, we used Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to DNA-metabarcode environmental samples using a ca. 4,500 bp marker that included most of the eukaryote SSU and LSU rRNA genes and the complete ITS region. We developed an analysis pipeline that reduced error rates to levels comparable to short-read platforms. Validation using a mock community indicated that our pipeline detected 98\% of chimeras de novo. We recovered 947 OTUs from water and sediment samples from a natural lake, 848 of which could be classified to phylum, 397 to genus and 330 to species. By allowing for the simultaneous use of three databases (Unite, SILVA and RDP LSU), long-read DNA metabarcoding provided better taxonomic resolution than any single marker. We foresee the use of long reads enabling the cross-validation of reference sequences and the synthesis of ribosomal rRNA gene databases. The universal nature of the rRNA operon and our recovery of {$>$}100 nonfungal OTUs indicate that long-read DNA metabarcoding holds promise for studies of eukaryotic diversity more broadly.},

  abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is used often in DNA metabarcoding of fungi. One disadvantage of its high variability may be a failure to classify operational taxonomic units (OTUs) when no similar reference sequence exists. We tested whether the 5.8S region, often sequenced with ITS2 but discarded before analysis, could provide OTU classifications when ITS2 fails. We used in silico evaluation to compare classification success of 5.8S and ITS2 from the UNITE database when reference sequences of the same species, genus, or family were removed. We then developed an automated pipeline for a combined 5.8S--ITS2 analysis and applied it to mixed environmental samples containing many lineages that are underrepresented in databases. ITS was clearly superior for species-level classifications with a complete reference database, but 5.8S outperformed ITS at higher level classifications with an incomplete database. Our combined 5.8S-ITS2 pipeline classified 3{\texttimes} more fungal OTUs compared to ITS2 alone, particularly within Chytridiomycota (27{\texttimes}) and Rozellomycota (6{\texttimes}). Missing reference sequences led to the failure of ITS to classify many fungal OTUs at all, and to a significant underestimation of environmental fungal diversity. Using 5.8S to complement ITS classification will likely provide better estimates of diversity in lineages for which database coverage is poor.},

In this outdoor inoculation experiment, we assessed the virulence of six haploid Armillaria ostoyae strains along with their diploid parent towards 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings of Norway spruce (Picea abies), and determined their ability to colonise freshly cut stumps. As inoculum source an Armillaria-colonised hazelnut (Corylus avellana) stem segment was inserted into the soil substrate. Re-isolations from mycelial fans at the root collar of infected trees or stumps were made. Surprisingly, not a single haploid re-isolate could be recovered. Microsatellite genotyping of 133 re-isolates suggests that the inoculated haploid strains were diploidised either by mating propagules (basidiospores or haploid mycelia) already present in the soil substrate or naturally disseminated in the course of the experiment from nearby forests. Consequently, no conclusion about the infectious ability of haploid Armillaria mycelia under natural conditions can be drawn. Nonetheless, the diploid half-sib families resulting from the diploidisation showed varying degrees of virulence, with a high correlation between the experiment with 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings. Despite extensive genotyping of re-isolates, no evidence for somatic recombination between haploid mating propagules and diploidised mycelia was detected, suggesting that this is an uncommon phenomenon in A. ostoyae.},

Three different CNN architectures are compared together with three different feature representations, namely: k-mer spectral representation, Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) and character-level integer encoding.

  abstract = {Ribosomal RNAs are the most abundant and universal noncoding RNAs in living organisms. In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms. However, major differences between mammalian and yeast pre-ribosomal RNA processing have recently come to light.

  abstract = {A manmade stormwater wetland in Kalmar, SE Sweden, sized 1 ha and receiving water from residential and road areas, was monitored over the first years after inundation with respect to chemistry and biology. Water flow and chemistry was analysed in years 2--4, mainly on a monthly basis, but, in the final year, every second month. This revealed that total nitrogen, according to the Swedish Environmental Quality Criteria (EQC), typically showed moderate or high concentrations, whereas total phosphorous levels were very high or extremely high. Metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) concentrations were low or moderate in terms of EQC. Yearly average reduction of nitrogen was 173 kg ha-1 y-1, tending to increase over time, and for phosphorous 12.1 kg ha-1 y-1, tending to decrease. Vegetation analysis was performed in years 1--4 by noting all species in 27 consecutive zones around the wetland system. This showed that one year after filling with water, the vegetation was already well established with {$>$}30 plant species in the entire pond system, and this increased only slightly. After four years, the shoreline vegetation cover had become denser, especially with larger graminoids such as common reed (Phragmites australis) and sea club-rush (Bolboschoenus maritimus), and submersed vegetation almost disappeared. There was a tendency for common species to become more dominant, and for less common species to become rarer. Using sweep net sampling of benthic invertebrates during years 0--2, ca 50 species/higher taxa were observed during the first year, largely because of the appearance of many beetles, especially dytiscids. However, these decreased the following years. Apart from these animals, in the first few months the invertebrate colonisation was dominated by chironomids and corixids, whereas later prominent increases were noticed for the isopod Asellus aquaticus, the snail Physa fontinalis, and the mayfly nymph Cloeon dipterum. The results are discussed in terms of wetland values for biodiversity and nutrient reduction, suggesting that these objectives seem possible to combine in stormwater wetlands.},

  abstract = {The computational identification of novel microRNA (miRNA) genes is a challenging task in bioinformatics. Massive amounts of data describing unknown functional RNA transcripts have to be analyzed for putative miRNA candidates with automated computational pipelines. Beyond those miRNAs that meet the classical definition, high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed additional miRNA-like molecules that are derived by alternative biogenesis pathways. Exhaustive bioinformatics analyses on such data involve statistical issues as well as precise sequence and structure inspection not only of the functional mature part but also of the whole precursor sequence of the putative miRNA. Apart from a considerable amount of species-specific miRNAs, the majority of all those genes are conserved at least among closely related organisms. Some miRNAs, however, can be traced back to very early points in the evolution of eukaryotic species. Thus, the investigation of the conservation of newly found miRNA candidates comprises an important step in the computational annotation of miRNAs.Topics covered in this chapter include a review on the obvious problem of miRNA annotation and family definition, recommended pipelines of computational miRNA annotation or detection, and an overview of current computer tools for the prediction of miRNAs and their limitations. The chapter closes discussing how those bioinformatic approaches address the problem of faithful miRNA prediction and correct annotation.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic N deposition alters patterns of C and N cycling in temperate forests, where forest floor litter decomposition is a key process mediated by a diverse community of bacteria and fungi. To track forest floor decomposer activity we generated metatranscriptomes that simultaneously surveyed the actively expressed bacterial and eukaryote genes in the forest floor, to compare the impact of N deposition on the decomposers in two natural maple forests in Michigan, USA, where replicate field plots had been amended with N for 16 years. Site and N amendment responses were compared using about 74,000 carbohydrate active enzyme transcript sequences (CAZymes) in each metatranscriptome. Parallel ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surveys of bacterial and fungal biomass and taxonomic composition showed no significant differences in either biomass or OTU richness between the two sites or in response to N. Site and N amendment were not significant variables defining bacterial taxonomic composition, but they were significant for fungal community composition, explaining 17 and 14\% of the variability, respectively. The relative abundance of expressed bacterial and fungal CAZymes changed significantly with N amendment in one of the forests, and N-response trends were also identified in the second forest. Although the two ambient forests were similar in community biomass, taxonomic structure and active CAZyme profile, the shifts in active CAZyme profiles in response to N-amendment differed between the sites. One site responded with an over-expression of bacterial CAZymes, and the other site responded with an over-expression of both fungal and different bacterial CAZymes. Both sites showed reduced representation of fungal lignocellulose degrading enzymes in N-amendment plots. The metatranscriptome approach provided a holistic assessment of eukaryote and bacterial gene expression and is applicable to other systems where eukaryotes and bacteria interact.},

  abstract = {Mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes, approx. syn.: Homobasidiomycetes) produce~a diverse array of fruiting bodies, ranging from simple crust-like forms to complex, developmentally integrated forms, such as stinkhorns and veiled agarics. The 19th century Friesian system divided the mushroom-forming fungi according to macromorphology. The Friesian taxonomy has long been regarded as artificial, but it continues to influence the language of mycology and perceptions of fungal diversity. Throughout the 20th century, the phylogenetic significance of anatomical features was elucidated, and classifications that departed strongly from the Friesian system were proposed. However, the anatomical studies left many questions and controversies unresolved, due in part to the paucity of characters, as well as the general absence of explicit phylogenetic analyses. Problems in fruiting body evolution were among the first to be addressed when molecular characters became readily accessible in the late 1980s. Today, GenBank contains about 108,000 nucleotide sequences of `homobasidiomycetes', filed under 7300 unique names. Analyses of these data are providing an increasingly detailed and robust view of the phylogeny and the distribution of different fruiting body forms across the 14 major clades that make up the agaricomycetes. However, it would be wrong to suggest that all the important questions about fruiting body evolution have been resolved. Recent studies focusing on resupinate forms suggest that there may still be undetected major clades of agaricomycetes, which could have a significant impact on our estimates of the ancestral forms in this morphologically diverse group. Modern approaches, including comparative phylogenetic analyses and developmental studies, have the potential to yield novel insights into both the macroevolutionary processes and cellular mechanisms of fungal morphological evolution.},

  abstract = {The effective use of metabarcoding in biodiversity science has brought important analytical challenges due to the need to generate accurate taxonomic assignments. The assignment of sequences to genus or species level is critical for biodiversity surveys and biomonitoring, but it is particularly challenging as researchers must select the approach that best recovers information on species composition. This study evaluates the performance and accuracy of seven methods in recovering the species composition of mock communities by using COI barcode fragments. The mock communities varied in species number and specimen abundance, while upstream molecular and bioinformatic variables were held constant, and using a set of COI fragments. We evaluated the impact of parameter optimization on the quality of the predictions. Our results indicate that BLAST top hit competes well with more complex approaches if optimized for the mock community under study. For example, the two machine learning methods that were benchmarked proved more sensitive to reference database heterogeneity and completeness than methods based on sequence similarity. The accuracy of assignments was impacted by both species and specimen counts (query compositional heterogeneity) which ultimately influence the selection of appropriate software. We urge researchers to: (i) use realistic mock communities to allow optimization of parameters, regardless of the taxonomic assignment method employed; (ii) carefully choose and curate the reference databases including completeness; and (iii) use QIIME, BLAST or LCA methods, in conjunction with parameter tuning to better assign taxonomy to diverse communities, especially when information on species diversity is lacking for the area under study.},

  abstract = {The next frontier in the field of microbiome studies is identification of all microbes present in the microbiome and accurate determination of their abundance such that microbiome profiles can serve as reliable assessments of health or disease status. PCR-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenome shotgun sequencing technologies are the prevailing approaches used in microbiome analyses. Each poses a number of technical challenges associated with PCR amplification, sample availability, and cost of processing and analysis. In general, results from these two approaches rarely agree completely with each other. Here, we compare these methods utilizing a set of vaginal swab and lavage specimens from a cohort of 42 pregnant women collected for a pilot study exploring the effect of the vaginal microbiome on preterm birth. We generated the microbial community profiles from the sequencing reads of the V3V4 and V4V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene in the vaginal swab and lavage samples. For a subset of the vaginal samples from 12 subjects, we also performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing analysis and compared the results obtained from the PCR-based sequencing methods. Our findings suggest that sample composition and complexity, particularly at the species level, are major factors that must be considered when analyzing and interpreting microbiome data. Our approach to sequence analysis includes consideration of chimeric reads, by using our chimera-counting BlastBin program, and enables recovery of microbial content information generated during PCR-based sequencing methods, such that the microbial profiles more closely resemble those obtained from metagenomic read-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with most temperate and boreal tree species, but difficulties in measuring carbon allocation to these symbionts have prevented the assessment of their importance in forest ecosystems. Here, I surveyed allocation patterns in 14 culture studies and five field studies of ectomycorrhizal plants. In culture studies, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi (NPPf) was linearly related to total belowground net primary production (NPPb) by the equation NPPf = 41.5\% {\texttimes} NPPb - 11.3\% (r2 = 0.55, P {\textexclamdown} 0.001) and ranged from 1\% to 21\% of total net primary production. As a percentage of NPP, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi was highest at lowest plant growth rates and lowest nutrient availabilities. Because total belowground allocation can be estimated using carbon balance techniques, these relationships should allow ecologists to incorporate mycorrhizal fungi into existing ecosystem models. In field studies, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0\% to 22\% of total allocation, but wide differences in measurement techniques made intercomparisons difficult. Techniques such as fungal in-growth cores, root branching-order studies, and isotopic analyses could refine our estimates of turnover rates of fine roots, mycorrhizae, and extraradical hyphae. Together with ecosystem modeling, such techniques could soon provide good estimates of the relative importance of root vs. fungal allocation in belowground carbon budgets.},

  abstract = {Bayesian modeling has become an indispensable tool for ecological research because it is uniquely suited to deal with complexity in a statistically coherent way. This textbook provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the latest Bayesian methods-in language ecologists can understand. Unlike other books on the subject, this one emphasizes the principles behind the computations, giving ecologists a big-picture understanding of how to implement this powerful statistical approach.  \emph{Bayesian Models} is an essential primer for non-statisticians. It begins with a definition of probability and develops a step-by-step sequence of connected ideas, including basic distribution theory, network diagrams, hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and inference from single and multiple models. This unique book places less emphasis on computer coding, favoring instead a concise presentation of the mathematical statistics needed to understand how and why Bayesian analysis works. It also explains how to write out properly formulated hierarchical Bayesian models and use them in computing, research papers, and proposals.

  abstract = {Plants of the same and different species are often linked by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), and there is substantial disagreement in the literature about whether these linkages have important effects on plant-plant interactions, beyond simply providing mycorrhizal inoculum. Here, I attempt to reconcile opposing viewpoints by reviewing available evidence for three distinct mechanisms by which CMNs can affect plant-plant interactions. I also analyze the details of manipulative field experiments that have been conducted to test CMN effects on plant-plant interactions, and make recommendations for the kinds of future studies that will be most useful in moving forward. I argue that few experiments have unequivocally tested whether CMNs have unique effects on plant-plant interactions, and that these experiments have largely been ignored in favor of debates about the magnitude of resource flows (especially carbon) from plant to plant through CMNs. I suggest that progress on the debate will only be made through more thorough testing of alternative mechanisms besides plant-to-plant carbon flow, especially coupled with experimental manipulations of CMNs to test for consequences on specific aspects of plant community ecological processes.},

In addition, we discuss recently proposed alternatives to the MFE criterion such as the use of maximum expected accuracy (MEA) or centroid structures. The dynamic programming algorithms implicitly assume that the RNA molecule is in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, especially for long RNAs, this need not be the case.

  abstract = {Using the basic GenBank local alignment search tool program (BLAST) to identify fungi collected in a recently protected beech forest at Montricher (Switzerland), the number of ITS sequences associated to the wrong taxon name appears to be around 30\%, even higher than previously estimated. Such results rely on the in-depth re-examination of BLAST results for the most interesting species that were collected, viz. first records for Switzerland, rare or patrimonial species and problematic species (when BLAST top scores were equally high for different species), all belonging to Agaricomycotina. This paper dissects for the first time a number of sequence-based identifications, thereby showing in every detail---particularly to the user community of taxonomic information---why sequence-based identification in the context of a fungal inventory can easily go wrong. Our first conclusion is that in-depth examination of BLAST results is too time consuming to be considered as a routine approach for future inventories: we spent two months on verification of approx. 20 identifications. Apart from the fact that poor taxon coverage in public depositories remains the principal impediment for successful species identification, it can be deplored that even very recent fungal sequence deposits in GenBank involve an uncomfortably high number of misidentifications or errors with associated metadata. While checking the original publications associated with top score sequences for the few examples that were here re-examined, a positive consequence is that we uncovered over 80 type sequences that were not annotated as types in GenBank. Advantages and pitfalls of sequence-based identification are discussed, particularly in the light of undertaking fungal inventories. Recommendations are made to avoid or reduce some of the major problems with sequence-based identification. Nevertheless, the prospects for a more reliable sequence-based identification of fungi remain quite dim, unless authors are ready to check and update the metadata associated with previously deposited sequences in their publications.},

Labelled C was primarily found in fungal fatty acid biomarkers (and rarely in bacterial biomarkers), and in Collembola, but not in Acari and Enchytraeidae. The production of sporocarps of ECM fungi was totally dependent on allocation of recent photosynthate in the late season. There was no short-term (2 wk) effect of additions of N to the soil, but after 1 yr, there was a 60\% reduction of below-ground C allocation to soil biota. {$\bullet$} Thus, organisms in forest soils, and their roles in ecosystem functions, appear highly sensitive to plant physiological responses to two major aspects of global change: changes in seasonal weather patterns and N eutrophication.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of the model space explored in statistical phylogenetics, emphasizing the need for new approaches to statistical model representation and software development. Clear communication and representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (i) reproducibility of an analysis, (ii) model development, and (iii) software design. Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the barrier for beginners and nonspecialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies. Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in the statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the large body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard components in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis--Hastings or Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution.

  abstract = {Programs for Bayesian inference of phylogeny currently implement a unique and fixed suite of models. Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study, while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs. We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-graphical models can be specified interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-specification language, and should be easy to learn for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous flexibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate, RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models in our field. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model choices that we make to critical scrutiny. RevBayes is freely available at http://www.RevBayes.com. [Bayesian inference; Graphical models; MCMC; statistical phylogenetics.]},

Huhndorf, were mainly based on morphology and thus were somewhat subjective. Later outlines by T. Lumbsch and S. Huhndorf, and Maharachchikumbura and co-authors, took into account phylogenetic evidence. However, even these phylogenetic driven arrangements for Sordariomycetes, were somewhat subjective, as the arrangements in trees depended on many variables, such as number of taxa, different gene regions and methods used in the analyses. What is needed is extra evidence to help standardize ranking in the fungi. Estimation of divergence times using molecular clock methods has been proposed for providing additional rational for higher ranking of taxa. Thus, in Sordariomycetes, a divergence period (i.e. 200--300 MYA) can be used as criteria to judge when a group of related taxa evolved and what rank they should be given. In this paper, we provide an updated classification of accepted subclasses, orders of Sordariomycetes and use divergence times to provide additional evidence to stabilize ranking of taxa in the class. We point out and discuss discrepancies where the phylogenetic tree conflicts with the molecular clock.},

Seven taxa in Coprinus (C. comatus, C. atramentarius, C. cinereus, C. micaceus, C. cordisporus, C. plicatilis, C. curtus), five potential sister group taxa (Psathyrella gracilis, Panaeolus semiovatus, Bolbitius vitellinus, Agrocybe praecox, Stropharia rugosoannulata), and two secotioid taxa (Podaxis pistillaris and Montagnea arenaria) were investigated. Restriction analysis was carried out on enzymatically amplified portions of the nuclear gene coding for the large ribosomal subunit RNA and the internally transcribed spacer region II. A total of 153 sites were mapped, of which 54 were phylogenetically informative. Six equally-most parsimonious networks were resolved using cladistic methods. One of these six networks was identified as best supported using a stepmatrix to weight restriction site gains over losses (character-state weighting). This tree demonstrates that: 1, the genus Coprinus is at least paraphyletic and probably polyphyletic; 2, Psathyrella is derived from within Coprinus; 3, the two secotioid taxa are closely related to Coprinus comatus; and, 4, the sister genus to Coprinus is Bolbitius. The branches of the character-state weighted tree have support similar to identical branches from the equally weighted tree as evidenced by three robustness indices. The character-state weighted tree provides a phylogenetic hypothesis similar to a strict consensus tree from unweighted parsimony analysis, but has the advantage of being fully resolved and thus provides a more detailed hypothesis for future research.}

One method for performing this search involves evaluating the Viterbi probability of a hidden Markov model (HMM) of a desired sequence family for each sequence in a protein database. However, one of the difficulties with current implementations is the time required to search large databases. Many current and upcoming architectures offering large amounts of compute power are designed with data-parallel execution and streaming in mind. We present a streaming algorithm for evaluating an HMM's Viterbi probability and refine it for the specific HMM used in biological sequence search. We implement our streaming algorithm in the Brook language, allowing us to execute the algorithm on graphics processors. We demonstrate that this streaming algorithm on graphics processors can outperform available CPU implementations. We also demonstrate this implementation running on a 16 node graphics cluster.},

  abstract = {Molecular tools have now been applied for the past 5 years to dissect ectomycorrhizal (EM) community structure, and they have propelled a resurgence in interest in the field. Results from these studies have revealed that: (i) EM communities are impressively diverse and are patchily distributed at a fine scale below ground; (ii) there is a poor correspondence between fungi that appear dominant as sporocarps vs. those that appear dominant on roots; (iii) members of Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae, and/or non-thelephoroid resupinates are among the most abundant EM taxa in ecosystems sampled to date; (iv) dissimilar plants are associated with many of the same EM species when their roots intermingle --- this occurs on a small enough spatial scale that fungal individuals are likely to be shared by dissimilar plants; and (v) mycoheterotrophic plants have highly specific fungal associations. Although, these results have been impressive, they have been tempered by sampling difficulties and limited by the taxonomic resolution of restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Minor modifications of the sampling schemes, and more use of direct sequencing, has the potential to solve these problems. Use of additional methods, such as in situ hybridization to ribosomal RNA or hybridization coupled to microarrays, are necessary to open up the analysis of the mycelial component of community structure.},

In this study, the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) was used to assess the vegetation habitat and the structural equation model (SEM) was applied to quantify the influences of different environmental factors on FQI in the Kunyang open-pit phosphate rock mine in Yunnan Province, China. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed that great differences of vegetation community composition existed in the sampled plots, even those at similar distances to mining areas, which indicates that disturbing distance was not the only factor to determine the vegetation community. SEM results showed that Cu promoted the FQI most obviously (0.84), followed by Co (0.75), while the inhibition of Cd content in soil to the FQI was the most significant (-0.88), followed by TK (-0.82), and C (-0.79). Soil fertility quality and soil pollution indexes were also established to analyze the effects of comprehensive soil parameters on FQI. The results showed that the soil fertility quality index had a strong negative effect on FQI, which revealed that higher levels of TP, TN, TK, and other nutrients in the soil would produce `toxicity' to the growth of vegetation. Findings from our study could provide a scientific method for assessing the ecological restoration results in the mining area.},

  abstract = {Species of Trichocomaceae occur commonly and are important to both industry and medicine. They are associated with food spoilage and mycotoxin production and can occur in the indoor environment, causing health hazards by the formation of {$\beta$}-glucans, mycotoxins and surface proteins. Some species are opportunistic pathogens, while others are exploited in biotechnology for the production of enzymes, antibiotics and other products. Penicillium belongs phylogenetically to Trichocomaceae and more than 250 species are currently accepted in this genus. In this study, we investigated the relationship of Penicillium to other genera of Trichocomaceae and studied in detail the phylogeny of the genus itself. In order to study these relationships, partial RPB1, RPB2 (RNA polymerase II genes), Tsr1 (putative ribosome biogenesis protein) and Cct8 (putative chaperonin complex component TCP-1) gene sequences were obtained. The Trichocomaceae are divided in three separate families: Aspergillaceae, Thermoascaceae and Trichocomaceae. The Aspergillaceae are characterised by the formation flask-shaped or cylindrical phialides, asci produced inside cleistothecia or surrounded by H{\"u}lle cells and mainly ascospores with a furrow or slit, while the Trichocomaceae are defined by the formation of lanceolate phialides, asci borne within a tuft or layer of loose hyphae and ascospores lacking a slit. Thermoascus and Paecilomyces, both members of Thermoascaceae, also form ascospores lacking a furrow or slit, but are differentiated from Trichocomaceae by the production of asci from croziers and their thermotolerant or thermophilic nature. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Penicillium is polyphyletic. The genus is re-defined and a monophyletic genus for both anamorphs and teleomorphs is created (Penicillium sensu stricto). The genera Thysanophora, Eupenicillium, Chromocleista, Hemicarpenteles and Torulomyces belong in Penicilliums. str. and new combinations for the species belonging to these genera are proposed. Analysis of Penicillium below genus rank revealed the presence of 25 clades. A new classification system including both anamorph and teleomorph species is proposed and these 25 clades are treated here as sections. An overview of species belonging to each section is presented.

  abstract = {The Guineo-Sudanian and Sudanian zones are home to predominantly ectomycorrhizal (EcM) plant communities dominated by members of the families Fabaceae (subfamily Ceasalpinioidae), Phyllanthaceae and Dipterocarpaceae. Numerous studies have shown that the aggregation of EcM trees is facilitated in part by the shared mycelial networks of EcM fungi. Mycelial networks involving mature trees would thus directly affect the survival of the seedlings of EcM trees and, thereby, the spatial structuring of the trees. In this study, we investigated the structure and spatial interactions of three vegetation types dominated by different EcM trees, namely, Isoberlinia doka, I. tomentosa and Uapaca togoensis. Three 50 m {\texttimes} 50 m plots were installed for each vegetation type. All EcM trees present in each plot were counted for estimation of density. Ripley's second order function K was used to estimate the spatial structure of EcMs trees. Spatial distribution of trees differed between species. Repulsion occurred at scales of 1 to 5 m between the different EcM trees species. By sharing nutrient through mycelial network, repulsion mechanisms observed during interaction between plants should have been cancelled but this was not observed in this study.}

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualisms with plant roots that increase plant growth and shape plant communities. Each AM fungal cell contains a large amount of genetic diversity, but it is unclear if this diversity varies across evolutionary lineages. We found that sequence variation in the nuclear large-subunit (LSU) rRNA gene from 29 isolates representing 21 AM fungal species generally assorted into genus- and species-level clades, with the exception of species of the genera Claroideoglomus and Entrophospora. However, there were significant differences in the levels of sequence variation across the phylogeny and between genera, indicating that it is an evolutionarily constrained trait in AM fungi. These consistent patterns of sequence variation across both phylogenetic and taxonomic groups pose challenges to interpreting operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as approximations of species-level groups of AM fungi. We demonstrate that the OTUs produced by five sequence clustering methods using 97\% or equivalent sequence similarity thresholds failed to match the expected species of AM fungi, although OTUs from AbundantOTU, CD-HIT-OTU, and CROP corresponded better to species than did OTUs from mothur or UPARSE. This lack of OTU-to-species correspondence resulted both from sequences of one species being split into multiple OTUs and from sequences of multiple species being lumped into the same OTU. The OTU richness therefore will not reliably correspond to the AM fungal species richness in environmental samples. Conservatively, this error can overestimate species richness by 4-fold or underestimate richness by one-half, and the direction of this error will depend on the genera represented in the sample. IMPORTANCE Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form important mutualisms with the roots of most plant species. Individual AM fungi are genetically diverse, but it is unclear whether the level of this diversity differs among evolutionary lineages. We found that the amount of sequence variation in an rRNA gene that is commonly used to identify AM fungal species varied significantly between evolutionary groups that correspond to different genera, with the exception of two genera that are genetically indistinguishable from each other. When we clustered groups of similar sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using five different clustering methods, these patterns of sequence variation caused the number of OTUs to either over- or underestimate the actual number of AM fungal species, depending on the genus. Our results indicate that OTU-based inferences about AM fungal species composition from environmental sequences can be improved if they take these taxonomically structured patterns of sequence variation into account.},

  abstract = {Summary Hill numbers (or the effective number of species) have been increasingly used to quantify the species/taxonomic diversity of an assemblage. The sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage. Two examples are demonstrated, using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data) included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical displays.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Termitomyces mushrooms are mutualistically associated with fungus-growing termites, which are widely considered to cultivate a monogenotypic Termitomyces symbiont within a colony. Termitomyces cultures iso-lated directly from termite colonies are heterokaryotic, likely through mating between compatible homokaryons. Results:{\enspace} After pairing homokaryons carrying different haplotypes at marker gene loci MIP and RCB from a Termitomyces fruiting body associated with Odontotermes formosanus, we observed nuclear fusion and division, which greatly resembled meiosis, during each hyphal cell division and conidial formation in the resulting heterokaryons. Surpris-ingly, nuclei in homokaryons also behaved similarly. To confirm if meiotic-like recombination occurred within mycelia, we constructed whole-genome sequencing libraries from mycelia of two homokaryons and a heterokaryon resulting from mating of the two homokaryons. Obtained reads were aligned to the reference genome of Termitomyces sp. J132 for haplotype reconstruction. After removal of the recombinant haplotypes shared between the heterokaryon and either homokaryons, we inferred that 5.04\% of the haplotypes from the heterokaryon were the recombinants result-ing from homologous recombination distributed genome-wide. With RNA transcripts of four meiosis-specific genes, including SPO11, DMC1, MSH4, and MLH1, detected from a mycelial sample by real-time quantitative PCR, the nuclear behavior in mycelia was reconfirmed meiotic-like. Conclusion:{\enspace} Unlike other basidiomycetes where sex is largely restricted to basidia, Termitomyces maximizes sexuality at somatic stage, resulting in an ever-changing genotype composed of a myriad of coexisting heterogeneous nuclei in a heterokaryon. Somatic meiotic-like recombination may endow Termitomyces with agility to cope with termite consumption by maximized genetic variability.},

  abstract = {We describe an efficient method for assembling short reads into long sequences. In this method, a hashing technique is used to compute overlaps between short reads, allowing base mismatches in the overlaps. Then an overlap graph is constructed, with each vertex representing a read and each edge representing an overlap. The overlap graph is explored by graph algorithms to find unique paths of reads representing contigs. The consensus sequence of each contig is constructed by computing alignments of multiple reads without gaps. This strategy has been implemented as a short read assembly program called PCAP.Solexa. We also describe how to use PCAP. Solexa in assembly of short reads.},

In SACall, the convolution layers are used to downsample the signals and capture the local patterns. To achieve the contextual relevance of signals, self-attention layers are adopted to calculate the similarity of the signals at any two positions in the raw signal sequence. Finally, the CTC decoder generates the DNA sequence by a beam search algorithm. We use a benchmark consisting of nine isolate genomes for testing the quality of different basecallers including SACall, Albacore, and Guppy. The performances of basecallers are evaluated from the perspective of read accuracy, assembly quality, and consensus accuracy. Among most of the genomes in the test benchmark, the reads basecalled by SACall have fewer errors than the reads basecalled by other basecallers. When assembling the basecalled reads of each genome, the assembly from reads basecalled by SACall achieves a higher assembly identity. In addition, there are fewer errors in the polished assembly from reads basecalled by SACall compared to those basecalled by Albacore and Guppy.},

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between {\textpm}1.},

Here we propose zeta ({$\zeta$}) diversity, the number of species shared by multiple assemblages, as a concept and metric that unifies incidence-based diversity measures, patterns, and relationships. Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantifies the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

  abstract = {Multi-species distribution modeling, which relates the occurrence of multiple species to environmental variables, is an important tool used by ecologists for both predicting the distribution of species in a community and identifying the important variables driving species co-occurrences. Recently, Dunstan, Foster and Darnell [ Ecol. Model. 222 (2011) 955--963] proposed using finite mixture of regression (FMR) models for multi-species distribution modeling, where species are clustered based on their environmental response to form a small number of ``archetypal responses.'' As an illustrative example, they applied their mixture model approach to a presence--absence data set of 200 marine organisms, collected along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Little attention, however, was given to the problem of model selection---since the archetypes (mixture components) may depend on different but likely overlapping sets of covariates, a method is needed for performing variable selection on all components simultaneously. In this article, we consider using penalized likelihood functions for variable selection in FMR models. We propose two penalties which exploit the grouped structure of the covariates, that is, each covariate is represented by a group of coefficients, one for each component. This leads to an attractive form of shrinkage that allows a covariate to be removed from all components simultaneously. Both penalties are shown to possess specific forms of variable selection consistency, with simulations indicating they outperform other methods which do not take into account the grouped structure. When applied to the Great Barrier Reef data set, penalized FMR models offer more insight into the important variables driving species co-occurrence in the marine community (compared to previous results where no model selection was conducted), while offering a computationally stable method of modeling complex species--environment relationships (through regularization).},

  abstract = {To date, the majority of mycological studies are focused on Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Research on basal fungi is rather limited with an obvious scarcity of data. Classification of basal fungi has witnessed ongoing changes in the last few decades. There have been numerous taxonomic revisions, establishment of new phyla and debates on the possibility to exclude some basal lineages from the currently circumscribed fungal groups. Zoosporic phyla such as Rozellomycota, Aphelidiomycota and Chytridiomycota are characterized by zoospores, which are motile spores with a flagellum. The position of the first two within the fungal kingdom is currently being debated. Non zoosporic phyla are collectively called zygomycetous fungi and include Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota. Basal fungi perform important ecological roles. Some groups of basal fungi control the population density of plankton, Oomycetes, aphids, and small invertebrates, while taking part in recycling of energy and matter in food webs. A few basal fungi are known for uptaking toxic heavy metals from the environment. The earliest basal fungi emerged just after the divergence of the nucleariid line of phagotrophs. Various taxonomic studies question the monophyly of some basal phyla, such as Chytridiomycota. Depending on the life mode of the fungi and whether motile or non-motile spores are produced, the isolation methods differ. For the culture of parasitic zoosporic fungi, co-culturing the fungi with their host is recommended while for saprobes ones, baits can be used. For zygomycetous fungi, common methods include dilution plating and direct inoculation. In this review, we pinpoint research gaps and discuss the current classification schemes along with information on evolution, diversity, current methods and challenges to isolate and culture basal fungi.},

At the same time, deep sequencing can lead to overestimates of microbial diversity through the generation of low-frequency, error-prone reads. Even with sequencing error rates below 0.005 per nucleotide position, the common method of generating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by multiple sequence alignment and complete-linkage clustering significantly increases the number of predicted OTUs and inflates richness estimates. We show that a 2\% single-linkage preclustering methodology followed by an average-linkage clustering based on pairwise alignments more accurately predicts expected OTUs in both single and pooled template preparations of known taxonomic composition. This new clustering method can reduce the OTU richness in environmental samples by as much as 30--60\% but does not reduce the fraction of OTUs in long-tailed rank abundance curves that defines the rare biosphere.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random ``shotgun'' approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

Typical projects may involve hundreds of samples and billions of sequencing reads. The comparison of such samples against a protein reference database generates billions of alignments and the analysis of such data is computationally challenging. To address this, we have substantially rewritten and extended our widely-used microbiome analysis tool MEGAN so as to facilitate the interactive analysis of the taxonomic and functional content of very large microbiome datasets. Other new features include a functional classifier called InterPro2GO, gene-centric read assembly, principal coordinate analysis of taxonomy and function, and support for metadata. The new program is called MEGAN Community Edition (CE) and is open source. By integrating MEGAN CE with our high-throughput DNA-to-protein alignment tool DIAMOND and by providing a new program MeganServer that allows access to metagenome analysis files hosted on a server, we provide a straightforward, yet powerful and complete pipeline for the analysis of metagenome shotgun sequences. We illustrate how to perform a full-scale computational analysis of a metagenomic sequencing project, involving 12 samples and 800 million reads, in less than three days on a single server.

These online tools generate interactive graphical outputs of relevant chromosomal regions, showing genes, transcripts, and other genomic landmarks, and epigenetic features mapped by projects such as ENCODE.This chapter provides a broad overview of the major genomic databases and browsers, and describes various approaches and the latest resources for searching them. Methods are provided for identifying genomic locus and sequence information using gene names or codes, identifiers for DNA and RNA molecules and proteins; also from karyotype bands, chromosomal coordinates, sequences, motifs, and matrix-based patterns. Approaches are also described for batch retrieval of genomic information, performing more complex queries, and analyzing larger sets of experimental data, for example from next-generation sequencing projects.},

  abstract = {In the arid and semiarid regions of North America, discrete precipitation pulses are important triggers for biological activity. The timing and magnitude of these pulses may differentially affect the activity of plants and microbes, combining to influence the C balance of desert ecosystems. Here, we evaluate how a ``pulse'' of water influences physiological activity in plants, soils and ecosystems, and how characteristics, such as precipitation pulse size and frequency are important controllers of biological and physical processes in arid land ecosystems. We show that pulse size regulates C balance by determining the temporal duration of activity for different components of the biota. Microbial respiration responds to very small events, but the relationship between pulse size and duration of activity likely saturates at moderate event sizes. Photosynthetic activity of vascular plants generally increases following relatively larger pulses or a series of small pulses. In this case, the duration of physiological activity is an increasing function of pulse size up to events that are infrequent in these hydroclimatological regions. This differential responsiveness of photosynthesis and respiration results in arid ecosystems acting as immediate C sources to the atmosphere following rainfall, with subsequent periods of C accumulation should pulse size be sufficient to initiate vascular plant activity. Using the average pulse size distributions in the North American deserts, a simple modeling exercise shows that net ecosystem exchange of CO2 is sensitive to changes in the event size distribution representative of wet and dry years. An important regulator of the pulse response is initial soil and canopy conditions and the physical structuring of bare soil and beneath canopy patches on the landscape. Initial condition influences responses to pulses of varying magnitude, while bare soil/beneath canopy patches interact to introduce nonlinearity in the relationship between pulse size and soil water response. Building on this conceptual framework and developing a greater understanding of the complexities of these eco-hydrologic systems may enhance our ability to describe the ecology of desert ecosystems and their sensitivity to global change.},

  abstract = {Physiological activity and structural dynamics in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are driven by discrete inputs or ``pulses'' of growing season precipitation. Here we describe the short-term dynamics of ecosystem physiology in experimental stands of native (Heteropogon contortus) and invasive (Eragrostis lehmanniana) grasses to an irrigation pulse across two geomorphic surfaces with distinctly different soils: a Pleistocene-aged surface with high clay content in a strongly horizonated soil, and a Holocene-aged surface with low clay content in homogenously structured soils. We evaluated whole-ecosystem and leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange, soil CO2 efflux, along with plant and soil water status to understand potential constraints on whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during the initiation of the summer monsoon season. Prior to the irrigation pulse, both invasive and native grasses had less negative pre-dawn water potentials ({$\Psi$}pd), greater leaf photosynthetic rates (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gs), and greater rates of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) on the Pleistocene surface than on the Holocene. Twenty-four hours following the experimental application of a 39 mm irrigation pulse, soil CO2 efflux increased leading to all plots losing CO2 to the atmosphere over the course of a day. Invasive species stands had greater evapotranspiration rates (ET) immediately following the precipitation pulse than did native stands, while maximum instantaneous NEE increased for both species and surfaces at roughly the same rate. The differential ET patterns through time were correlated with an earlier decline in NEE in the invasive species as compared to the native species plots. Plots with invasive species accumulated between 5\% and 33\% of the carbon that plots with the native species accumulated over the 15-day pulse period. Taken together, these results indicate that system CO2 efflux (both the physical displacement of soil CO2 by water along with plant and microbial respiration) strongly controls whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during precipitation pulses. Since CO2 and H2O loss to the atmosphere was partially driven by species effects on soil microclimate, understanding the mechanistic relationships between the soil characteristics, plant ecophysiological responses, and canopy structural dynamics will be important for understanding the effects of shifting precipitation and vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments.},

The aim of this chapter is to provide practical procedures to determine a protein crystal structure, illustrating the new techniques, experimental methods, and software that have made protein crystallography a tool accessible to a larger scientific community.It is impossible to give more than a taste of what the X-ray crystallographic technique entails in one brief chapter and there are different ways to solve a protein structure. Since the number of structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is becoming ever larger (the protein data bank now contains more than 100,000 entries) and therefore the probability to find a good model to solve the structure is ever increasing, we focus our attention on the Molecular Replacement method. Indeed, whenever applicable, this method allows the resolution of macromolecular structures starting from a single data set and a search model downloaded from the PDB, with the aid only of computer work.},

In the top 20 cm of substrate, 87\% of the root pieces occurred. Irrespective of depth, sheathing mycorrhizas were found on 83\% of the root pieces. While the percentages of Paxillus-type mycorrhizas decreased with soil depth, those of a Scleroderma-type significantly increased. Total numbers of mycorrhizas counted at the end-of-season were independent of substrate temperatures. However, numbers of Paxillus-type mycorrhizas were inversely related to both annual mean and spring substrate temperatures, whereas those of the Scleroderma-type were directly related. Vegetative cultures of Scleroderma citrinum grew on an agar medium at 30{$^\circ$}C, whereas those of Paxillus involutus did not; at lower temperatures the two fungi responded similarly to temperature changes. The evidence suggests that the observed patterns of mycorrhizal development reflect the changing competitive abilities of Scleroderma and Paxillus and/or host influences at different temperatures in the range 8--16{$^\circ$}C.},

Success at this step not only depends on the reliability of the fungal inoculum used for plantlet mycorrhization but also on the environmental conditions attending symbiosis establishment. Methods developed 40--50 years ago for inoculating host plants with EEMMs are still largely used today, with slight modifications. Mycelial inoculations are used commercially only for some edible ectomycorrhizal (EEM) basidiomycetes, while inoculation with spores is the most common method for producing seedlings colonized with truffle mycorrhizas. However, pure cultures and ectomycorrhizas of Tuber have also been used to obtain mycorrhizal plants mainly for scientific purposes. Mycelium-based inoculum offers many advantages, such as lower contamination risks and more reliable root colonization and provides opportunities for genetic selection of EEMM strains. The long-time preservation of EEM cultures and the creation of germ plasm banks would be an important step to support mycelium-based technologies. To this aim, we demonstrate successful cryopreservation of strains of Tuber borchii and Tuber aestivum. Recent advances in genetics and biotechnology of EEMs and their hosts have the potential to transform the current EEMM nursery trade.},

  abstract = {Sequence alignment is the task of finding similarities between sequences. It has been a central building block in molecular biology since DNA, RNA and protein sequences were first obtained half a century ago. Sequence alignment is applied to research and medicine, with applications in evolutionary biology, genome assembly, oncology and many others. The analyses of the growing amounts of genomic data require algorithms with high accuracy and speed. Moreover, the ongoing transition from single genome references to pangenomes (representative for a whole population) motivates novel alignment algorithms.  We consider the two problems: semi-global alignment of a set of DNA reads to a pangenome graph reference (possibly containing cycles), and global (end-to-end) alignment of two sequences. Recent theoretical results conclude that strongly subquadratic algorithms are unlikely to exist for the worst case. Moreover, the runtime and memory of existing optimal algorithms scale quadratically even for similar sequences. An open problem is to develop an algorithm with linear-like empirical scaling on inputs where the errors are linear in n. In the present thesis we introduce an approach that aims to solve this problem in order to develop practical optimal alignment algorithms.  Modern optimal aligners perform uninformed search -- they neglect information from the not-yet-aligned parts of the sequences. We exploit this information in a principled framework where an alignment with minimal edit distance is equivalent to a shortest path in an alignment graph, and the remaining information about the sequences is captured in a heuristic function that estimates the length of a remaining shortest path. The classic shortest path algorithm A* uses such a heuristic to direct the search, and yet it finds provably shortest paths given that the heuristic is admissible, i.e. it always return a lower bound on the edit distance of the remaining suffixes. Curiously, previous attempts to apply A* to multiple sequence alignment (MSA), did not result in practical algorithms even for pairwise alignment. In the present thesis we investigate how to do that. In the shortest path formulation, we (i) suggest a novel highly-informed admissible heuristic, (ii) design efficient algorithms and data structures for computing the heuristic, (iii) prove their optimality, (iv) implement the presented algorithms, and (v) compare their performance and scaling to other optimal algorithms. Our approach is provably optimal according to edit distance, its runtime empirically scales subquadratically (and sometimes even near-linearly) with the output size, which translates to orders of magnitude of speedup compared to state-of-the-art optimal algorithms.  Throughout this thesis, we demonstrate how to encompass various dimensions of the input complexity while preserving the speed and optimality. First, we demonstrate how to apply a trie index to scale the alignment runtime sublinearly with the reference size. Then, we introduce a novel seed heuristic for A* which enables aligning of long sequences (up to 100 Mbp) near-linearly with their length. Last, we extend the seed heuristic to a general chaining seed heuristic that encompasses inexact matching, match chaining, and gap costs to raise the tolerated error rate (to 30\% for synthetic data and 10\% for real data). Interestingly, our seed heuristic challenges the omnipresent seed-(chain)-extend paradigm to sequence alignment which aims to connect long and high-quality seed matches. We, instead, use the information of the lack of matches to dismiss suboptimal alignments, which leads to optimizing seeds for being short and not having many matches.  These first steps to scalable optimal alignment using A* give rise to a number of research directions: approaching other alignment types, more general optimization metrics, relaxed optimality guarantees, performance analyses, improved heuristics, applications outside of biology, and more performant algorithms and implementations.},

  abstract = {Assessing genetic variation within populations and genetic exchange between populations requires an understanding of the distribution and abundance of individual genotypes within the population. Previous workers have used somatic incompatibility testing to distinguish clones or individuals in natural populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, somatic incompatibility tests performed with isolates of Suillus granulatus from a natural population revealed a lack of transitiveness, which brought into question the validity of this method. Subsequent studies of genetic identity of these isolates, using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, conclusively showed that somatically compatible isolates are not necessarily genetically identical. RAPD marker analysis is more reliable and provides higher resolution of genotype distribution in natural populations than does somatic incompatibility testing. This is of particular importance in populations of organisms such as ectomycorrhizal fungi in which the mating systems are incompletely known.},

We compared herbarium specimens at different ages and fresh samples of four mushroom species (Kuehneromyces mutabilis, Hypholoma capnoides, Kuehneromyces lignicola, Hypholoma fasciculare) of two genera in the family Strophariaceae by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA). 25 metabolites were identified. No significant alterations were found between herbarium samples at different ages, suggesting that they are stable enough for comparative studies. The most dominant differences between fresh and herbarium samples was that sugars such as {$\alpha$}-{$\alpha$}-trehalose, and fumaric and malic acids were more abundant in fresh fungi. Total contents of fatty and amino acids, uracil and {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were higher in herbarium specimens. In addition, pyroglutamic acid was observed only in Kuehneromyces mutabilis and fasciculic acid E in Hypholoma fasciculare. Hence, based on results of the studied taxa, we conclude that NMR metabolomics can be used for both fresh and dried mushrooms when such alterations are properly addressed.},

  abstract = {Transport and exchange of nutrients is a key feature to the function of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and therefore also to the function of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). These networks establish between two or more plant individuals and one or more extraradical mycelia (EM). Complex networks with many nodes and linkages can be observed in sterile cultures and are probably common in nature. This chapter aims to describe how the nutrient dynamics of the CMNs influence plant competition. The discussion will concentrate on the rather variable access of the individual plants to the nutrient pool in the EM. Plant-to-plant transfer of nutrients via one or more connective EM does not appear to occur in significant quantities except in special cases. Competition between individual plants is in general asymmetric such that larger individuals will obtain a disproportionate share of a limited resource and suppress the growth of smaller individuals. Our major challenge is to unravel whether nutrient dynamics in CMNs will result in even stronger or in more relaxed competition. We investigated common outcomes in competition studies including: (a) adult plant-seedling combinations; (b) intraspecific competition of plant populations of similar age and (c) interspecific competition of plants of similar age. Results from root organ culture models indicate that AM fungi transfer phosphorus (P) to roots representing the strongest carbon (C) source strength. This is in accordance with the results of 32P-aided studies of P translocation in CMNs with large plants and seedlings. An evaluation of these results together with CMN studies not involving tracers leads us to suggest that nutrients in the EM are distributed to the plants in accordance with their size or C source strength. In consequence, the CMN may rather amplify than relax the competition towards establishing seedlings. Our model implies, however, that the suppression of the seedling is only temporary and is likely to shift to a typical mycorrhizal growth response when the large plant become senescent or is grazed. In conspecific plant populations we predict that AM fungal networks confer an advantage to plant individuals that are for various reasons slightly larger than their neighbors. Interspecific plant competition is more difficult to predict as different combinations of species-specific traits may either amplify or relax nutrient competition in a CMN in addition to effects of size differences. Future research needs are discussed including the need to investigate roles of CMNs in interplant transfer of plant signals and allelochemicals.},

  abstract = {Agaricomycetes, the mushrooms, are considered to have a promiscuous mating system, because most populations have a large number of mating types. This diversity of mating types ensures a high outcrossing efficiency, the probability of encountering a compatible mate when mating at random, because nearly every homokaryotic genotype is compatible with every other. Here I summarize the data from mating type surveys and genetic analysis of mating type loci and ask what evolutionary and ecological factors have promoted promiscuity. Outcrossing efficiency is equally high in both bipolar and tetrapolar species with a median value of 0.967 in Agaricomycetes. The sessile nature of the homokaryotic mycelium coupled with frequent long distance dispersal could account for selection favoring a high outcrossing efficiency as opportunities for choosing mates may be minimal. Consistent with a role of mating type in mediating cytoplasmic-nuclear genomic conflict, Agaricomycetes have evolved away from a haploid yeast phase towards hyphal fusions that display reciprocal nuclear migration after mating rather than cytoplasmic fusion. Importantly, the evolution of this mating behavior is precisely timed with the onset of diversification of mating type alleles at the pheromone/receptor mating type loci that are known to control reciprocal nuclear migration during mating. While reciprocal nuclear exchange may have released some of the restrictions on the evolution of multiple mating types, it may also have fostered a nuclear ``arms race'' that favored the evolution of selfish alleles with greater access to conspecific mycelia. Such selection could potentially increase mating type diversity through rapid diversification of novel, more fully compatible forms or may actually reduce outcrossing efficiency by skewing mating type allele frequencies towards more selfish alleles. Distinguishing among the possible mechanisms involved in promoting promiscuity will require extensive testing of correlates between allele number and cytological, ecological, and demographic factors across a broad range of species.},

We first review the current status of the fungal tree and highlight areas where additional effort will be required. We then review the analytical challenges imposed by the volume of data and discuss methods to recover the most accurate species tree given the sea of gene trees. Highly resolved and deeply sampled trees are being leveraged in novel ways to study fungal radiations, species delimitation, and metabolic evolution. Finally, we discuss the critical issue of incorporating the unnamed and uncultured dark matter taxa that represent the vast majority of fungal diversity.},

  abstract = {High-throughput DNA metabarcoding of amplicon sizes below 500 bp has revolutionized the analysis of environmental microbial diversity. However, these short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. This lesser phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons may be overcome by new long-read sequencing technologies. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain an 4500-bp region spanning most of the eukaryotic small subunit (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal DNA genes. We first treated the CCS reads with a novel curation workflow, generating 650 high-quality operational taxonomic units (OTUs) containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions. To assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based methods. The taxonomically annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing us to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1,019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58\%) corresponded to the new long environmental OTUs. The long reads also allowed us to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Together, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.},

  abstract = {The successful colonization of new habitats has played a fundamental role during the evolution of life. Salinity is one of the strongest barriers for organisms to cross, which has resulted in the evolution of distinct marine and non-marine (including both freshwater and soil) communities. Although microbes represent by far the vast majority of eukaryote diversity, the role of the salt barrier in shaping the diversity across the eukaryotic tree is poorly known. Traditional views suggest rare and ancient marine/non-marine transitions but this view is being challenged by the discovery of several recently transitioned lineages. Here, we investigate habitat evolution across the tree of eukaryotes using a unique set of taxon-rich phylogenies inferred from a combination of long-read and short-read environmental metabarcoding data spanning the ribosomal DNA operon. Our results show that, overall, marine and non-marine microbial communities are phylogenetically distinct but transitions have occurred in both directions in almost all major eukaryotic lineages, with hundreds of transition events detected. Some groups have experienced relatively high rates of transitions, most notably fungi for which crossing the salt barrier has probably been an important aspect of their successful diversification. At the deepest phylogenetic levels, ancestral habitat reconstruction analyses suggest that eukaryotes may have first evolved in non-marine habitats and that the two largest known eukaryotic assemblages (TSAR and Amorphea) arose in different habitats. Overall, our findings indicate that the salt barrier has played an important role during eukaryote evolution and provide a global perspective on habitat transitions in this domain of life.},

  abstract = {Genetic diversity is the basis for evolutionary adaptation and selection under changing environmental conditions. Phytoplankton populations are genotypically diverse, can become genetically differentiated within small spatiotemporal scales and many species form resting stages. Resting stage accumulations in sediments (seed banks) are expected to serve as reservoirs for genetic information, but so far their role in maintaining phytoplankton diversity and in evolution has remained unclear. In this study we used the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii (Dinophyceae) as a model organism to investigate if (i) the benthic seed bank is more diverse than the pelagic population and (ii) the pelagic population is seasonally differentiated. Resting stages (benthic) and plankton (pelagic) samples were collected at a coastal bloom site in the Baltic Sea, followed by cell isolation and genotyping using microsatellite markers (MS) and restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD). High clonal diversity (98\%--100\%) combined with intermediate to low gene diversity (0.58--0.03, depending on the marker) was found. Surprisingly, the benthic and pelagic fractions of the population were equally diverse, and the pelagic fraction was temporally homogeneous, despite seasonal fluctuation of environmental selection pressures. The results of this study suggest that continuous benthic--pelagic coupling, combined with frequent sexual reproduction, as indicated by persistent linkage equilibrium, prevent the dominance of single clonal lineages in a dynamic environment. Both processes harmonize the pelagic with the benthic population and thus prevent seasonal population differentiation. At the same time, frequent sexual reproduction and benthic--pelagic coupling maintain high clonal diversity in both habitats.},

  abstract = {Summary There are about 700 species of taxonomically diverse fungi that are be able to attack living nematodes (juveniles, adults, and eggs) and use them as a nutrient source (1 , 2). The most important genera include Purpureocillium, Pochonia, Hirsutella, Nematophthora, Arthrobotrys, Drechmeria, Fusarium, and Dactylellina (3 , 4). Among these nematophagous fungi, only a few species are obligate parasites of nematodes, but the majority are facultative saprophytes (5 -- 7). Based on the mechanisms by which they attack nematodes, these nematophagous fungi are usually divided into four general groups: (i) nematode-trapping fungi that use specialized trapping structures differentiated from hyphae; (ii) endoparasitic fungi that use their spores; (iii) the opportunistic fungi that invade or colonize nematode eggs, females, or cysts with their hyphal tips; and (iv) toxin-producing fungi that immobilize nematodes before invasion (1 , 8). Nematophagous fungi are important natural enemies of nematodes in soil ecosystems. In recent decades, environmental and health concerns over the use of chemical nematicides have greatly increased the demand for the development of biological control agents in plant protection. The reason for the growing interest in nematophagous fungi is mostly their potential as biocontrol agents against plant- and animal-parasitic nematodes. So far, a substantial number of myconematocides have been developed worldwide (3 , 4 , 6).},

  abstract = {The fungi-to-bacteria ratio in soil ecological concepts and its application to explain the effects of land use changes have gained increasing attention over the past decade. Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95\% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76\% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2{$\omega$}6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1{$\omega$}5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific {$\delta$}13C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future.},

In the U.S., the larges: losses of forested wetlands between the 1970s and 1980s occurred in southeastern states that had the most bottomland hardwood to begin with: Arkansas. Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These losses were due primarily to forestry and agriculture. Other sources of cumulative impact include decrease in average area of individual wetlands, shift in proportion of wetland types, change in spatial configuration of wetlands, and loss of cumulative wetland function at the landscape scale. For two wetland-related functions, flood flow and loading of suspended solids, watersheds that contained less than 10\% wetlands were more sensitive to incremental loss of wetland area than were watersheds with more than 10\% wetlands. The relative position of wetlands within a drainage network also influenced their cumulative function. Georgraphic Information Systems (GIS) are becoming an important tool for evaluating cumulative impacts and their effects.},

A recommendation is made about the generic name to use in cases in which two or more generic names are synonyms or taxonomically congruent along with the rationale for the recommendation. In some cases the recommended generic name does not have priority or is based on an asexual type species, thus needs to be protected and ultimately approved according to Art. 57.2 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN). A table is presented listing all competing generic names and their type species noting the recommended generic name.

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome partitioning strategies to sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to whole genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. High throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel enrichment of pre-selected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across labs focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to 1) increase the accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in non-model taxa by discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, 2) highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy, and 3) discuss the future of targeted capture and other genome partitioning approaches in light of the increasing accessibility of whole genome sequencing. Given the practical advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole genome sequencing.},

  abstract = {The sustainable use of the soil resource requires extensive knowledge about its genesis, morphology, and properties. Consequently, soil data are basis for improved land use management and soil conservation. The present study illustrates morphology and physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of the soils developed in the pediplain of Central Benin. The pediments are characterized by different substrate layers, whereas the material of valleys and the surroundings of inselbergs are of colluvial origin. Termites also play an important role in tropical soils by influencing soil properties. Movement of clay and sesquioxides are typical pedogenetic processes, resulting in the formation of horizons enriched with clay or of ferricrete. The soils of the study site are classified as Sols ferrugineux tropicaux lessiv{\'e}s, Sols hydromorphes, Sols min{\'e}raux bruts, and Sols bruns, according to the French Classification des Sols, as Alfisols, Inceptisols, or Entisols according to the U.S.D.A. Soil Taxonomy, or as Acrisols, Plinthosols, Gleysols, Fluvisols, Leptsols, and Cambisols according to the classification systems of the FAO-UNESCO legend and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. The assessment of soil shows that the fertility of the pediment soils is generally low due to the low amount of organic matter, nutrients and poor water holding capacity of the sandy topsoil. The loamy soils surrounding the inselberg as well as the areas influenced by termites are more fertile because of a higher amount of nutrients and better water holding capacity.},

This paper describes the integration of sediment microbial activities and natural precipitation processes, along with approaches to defining the contaminant load from the mine wastes. The contaminant removal rates, which can be expected by a wetland sediment, are summarized and how they need to be reflected in the wetland size required, and the carbon supply which is needed. Contaminant loading from mining wastes can be balanced by wetland ecological processes, including wetland primary production and microbial mineralization in the sediment. This ecological engineering approach is demonstrated using case studies on hard-rock mining waste in Canada.},

  abstract = {PCR is a formidable and potent technology that serves as an indispensable tool in a wide range of biological disciplines. However, due to the ease of use and often lack of rigorous standards many PCR applications can lead to highly variable, inaccurate, and ultimately meaningless results. Thus, rigorous method validation must precede its broad adoption to any new application. Multi-template samples possess particular features, which make their PCR analysis prone to artifacts and biases: multiple homologous templates present in copy numbers that vary within several orders of magnitude. Such conditions are a breeding ground for chimeras and heteroduplexes. Differences in template amplification efficiencies and template competition for reaction compounds undermine correct preservation of the original template ratio. In addition, the presence of inhibitors aggravates all of the above-mentioned problems. Inhibitors might also have ambivalent effects on the different templates within the same sample. Yet, no standard approaches exist for monitoring inhibitory effects in multitemplate PCR, which is crucial for establishing compatibility between samples.},

Valuable research outputs that are often locked up in figures and supplementary information files are encapsulated in Rfam entries and made accessible through the Rfam Web site. The data produced by Rfam have a broad application, from genome annotation to providing training sets for algorithm development.

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi constitute a source of income as well as proper food with considerable nutritional value. Although edible EcM fungi are highly diverse and expected to host considerable nutritional attributes, only few studies focus on their use and promotion in the province of Tshopo (DR Congo). This study provides original ethnomycological and diversity data on edible ectomycorrhizal rainforest fungi from the Man-and-Biosphere reserve of Yangambi and the reserve of Yoko. The list of edible fungi follows the current taxonomy. Taxa were collected in plots situated in different types of rainforests. Each taxon is supported by herbarium reference specimens. Ethnomycological data on locally consumed EcM fungi were collected from randomly selected people living near the Man-and-Biosphere reserve of Yangambi and the Yoko reserve. People were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The interview campaign involved 160 informants, all randomly selected from 6 different ethnic communities. The results reveal that rainforests from the Yangambi Biosphere reserve and Yoko forest reserve provide a relatively high number of edible fungi, more than local people actually use. Mixed forest stands hold the highest diversity in saprotrophic edible fungi (p value {$<$} 0.001) while no significant difference (p value {$>$} 0.05) was observed in the number of saprotrophic and EcM fungi within monodominant forests. In spite of being accessible, this renewable natural resource is underexploited. Although a wide array of EcM fungi is available in primary forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal trees, local people's major interest goes to the saprotrophic fungi from areas with degraded mixed forests. The lack of local interest for EcM fungi is probably related to the considerable distance people have to cover to collect them. As a result, the edible EcM fungi from the Tshopo area represent a potentially interesting but underutilized resource.},

  abstract = {Summary Mycoparasitism is a lifestyle where a living fungus (host or prey) is parasitized by and acts as a nutrient source of another fungus (mycoparasite or predator). Mycoparasitic interactions are common among fungi and, similar to plant pathogens, comprise both biotrophic as well as necrotrophic relationships. Biotrophic mycoparasites obtain their nutrition from living fungal host hyphae, with which they can live in a balanced relationship for extended stages of their life cycles, and usually show a narrow host range (1). Because of their nature, however, only few species are studied in detail and applied as biocontrol agents. Examples are Ampelomyces quisqualis (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina), a natural enemy of powdery mildews, whose genome sequence has recently been released, as well as haustorial biotrophs from the Zygomycota (2 , 3). In contrast to biotrophs, necrotrophic mycoparasites are more destructive and often rather unspecialized (4). They usually have wide host ranges, often comprising fungal plant pathogens, and kill their fungal prey by invasion and secretion of damaging molecules followed by feeding on the released nutrients (5 , 6). These traits render these fungi useful in agriculture for the biological control of plant diseases.},

However, the reference databases of full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences are skewed to well-studied ecosystems and subject to primer bias and chimerism, which results in an incomplete view of the diversity present in a sample. We combine poly(A)-tailing and reverse transcription of SSU rRNA molecules with synthetic long-read sequencing to generate high-quality, full-length SSU rRNA sequences, without primer bias, at high throughput. We apply our approach to samples from seven different ecosystems and obtain more than a million SSU rRNA sequences from all domains of life, with an estimated raw error rate of 0.17\%. We observe a large proportion of novel diversity, including several deeply branching phylum-level lineages putatively related to the Asgard Archaea. Our approach will enable expansion of the SSU rRNA reference databases by orders of magnitude, and contribute to a comprehensive census of the tree of life.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of multiple sequence alignment program MAFFT has been improved. The new version (5.3) of MAFFT offers new iterative refinement options, H-INS-i, F-INS-i and G-INS-i, in which pairwise alignment information are incorporated into objective function. These new options of MAFFT showed higher accuracy than currently available methods including TCoffee version 2 and CLUSTAL W in benchmark tests consisting of alignments of \&gt;50 sequences. Like the previously available options, the new options of MAFFT can handle hundreds of sequences on a standard desktop computer. We also examined the effect of the number of homologues included in an alignment. For a multiple alignment consisting of {$\sim$}8 sequences with low similarity, the accuracy was improved (2--10 percentage points) when the sequences were aligned together with dozens of their close homologues (E-value \&lt; 10-5--10-20) collected from a database. Such improvement was generally observed for most methods, but remarkably large for the new options of MAFFT proposed here. Thus, we made a Ruby script, mafftE.rb, which aligns the input sequences together with their close homologues collected from SwissProt using NCBI-BLAST.},

  abstract = {High throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from environmental DNA (aka DNA metabarcoding) has become an integral part of fungal ecology, enabling in-depth characterization of fungal communities. In most cases, the rDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region, which has a long history as a target in fungal systematics, is used as a DNA barcode marker. Despite improvements in sequencing techniques and bioinformatics approaches, there are inherent limitations associated with the use of a single-locus DNA marker that are often ignored. In this text, I discuss both inherent biological and methodological limitations associated with the use of the ITS marker. For example, proper species delimitation is often not possible with a single marker, and a significant DNA barcoding gap (i.e. interspecific divergence) is often missing between sister taxa in ITS. Further, we can rarely be fully confident about the assigned species-level taxonomy based on available reference sequences. In addition to the inherent limitations, an extra layer of complexity and variation is blended into DNA metabarcoding data due to PCR and sequencing errors that may look similar to natural molecular variation. The bioinformatics processing of ITS amplicons must take into account both the basic properties of the ITS region, as well as the generated errors and biases. In this regard, we cannot adopt approaches and settings from other markers, such as 16S and 18S, blindly. For example, due to intraspecific variability in the ITS region, and sometimes intragenomic variability, ITS sequences must be clustered to approach species level resolution in community studies. Therefore, I argue that the concept of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) is not applicable. Although the ITS region is by far the best option as a general DNA (meta)barcoding marker for fungi, this contribution is meant to remind against a naive or simplistic use of the ITS region, and for stimulating further discussions.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi play major ecological roles in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Although the richness of ECM fungal communities and the factors controlling their structure have been documented at local spatial scales, how they vary at larger spatial scales remains unclear. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Tedersoo et~al. (2012) present the results of a meta-analysis of ECM fungal community structure that sheds important new light on global-scale patterns. Using data from 69 study systems and 6021 fungal species, the researchers found that ECM fungal richness does not fit the classic latitudinal diversity gradient in which species richness peaks at lower latitudes. Instead, richness of ECM fungal communities has a unimodal relationship with latitude that peaks in temperate zones. Intriguingly, this conclusion suggests the mechanisms driving ECM fungal community richness may differ from those of many other organisms, including their plant hosts. Future research will be key to determine the robustness of this pattern and to examine the processes that generate and maintain global-scale gradients of ECM fungal richness.},

In this chapter, we discuss multiple hypotheses that have been put forth to explain the specificity of the Alnus ECM symbiosis and consider their strengths and weaknesses in light of current research on the topic. In addition to reviewing the range of suggested explanations, we also propose and discuss a new alternative explanation of Alnus ECM specificity involving three-way interactions among Alnus plants, ECM fungi, and Frankia bacteria. With specific regard to common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), we believe they may play an important role in the specificity observed in the Alnus ECM system. To understand that role in the larger context of research on Alnus ECM fungal communities, we begin our chapter with a synopsis of the studies documenting the unique specificity pattern. From there, we discuss why it appears to be advantageous for Alnus plants not to participate in interspecific CMNs. Finally, we elaborate on how specificity may be established and maintained in the Alnus ECM system and suggest what we consider to be promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {Despite covering vast areas of boreal North America, the ecological factors structuring mycorrhizal fungal communities in peatland forests are relatively poorly understood. To assess how these communities vary by age (younger vs. mature), habitat (fen vs. bog), and host (conifer trees vs. ericaceous shrub), we sampled the roots of two canopy trees (Larix laricina and Picea mariana) and an ericaceous shrub (Ledum groenlandicum) at four sites in northern Minnesota, USA. To characterize the specific influence of host co-occurrence on mycorrhizal fungal community structure, we also conducted a greenhouse bioassay using the same three hosts. Root samples were assessed using Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the ITS1 rRNA gene region. As expected, we found that the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi was high on both Larix and Picea, whereas ericoid mycorrhizal fungi had high relative abundance only on Ledum. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungal richness was significantly higher in mature forests, in bogs, and on Ledum hosts, while ectomycorrhizal fungal richness did not differ significantly across any of these three variables. In terms of community composition, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were more strongly influenced by host while ectomycorrhizal fungi were more influenced by habitat. In the greenhouse bioassay, the presence of Ledum had consistently stronger effects on the composition of ectomycorrhizal, ericoid, and ericoid-ectomycorrhizal fungal communities than either Larix or Picea. Collectively, these results suggest that partitioning HTS-based datasets by mycorrhizal type in boreal peatland forests is important, as their responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions are not likely to be uniform.},

Four new species with clamp connections are described: Cantharellus guineensis, C. mikemboensis, C. pseudomiomboensis and C. stramineus. The new taxa show moderate to strong resemblance to either Cantharellus rufopunctatus or C. miomboensis. A two-locus phylogeny, based on part of the protein coding genes rpb2 and tef-1, resolved them as a highly supported clade within Cantharellus subgenus Rubrinus, a subgenus still exclusively composed of tropical African species. This monophyletic clade is here described as a new section within subg. Rubrinus. As the subgenus was previously defined as being composed of chanterelles lacking clamp connections, the definition of the subgenus is here amended. Illustrations and new records are also presented for Cantharellus afrocibarius, C. defibulatus, C. miomboensis, C. rufopunctatus and C. sublaevis. This paper provides first sequences for C. defibulatus, C. rufopunctatus and C. sublaevis, all of which are here epitypified, as well as new sequences for more than a dozen other Cantharellus. Cantharellus cibarius var. latifolius is considered a synonym of C. afrocibarius. An identification key to all mainland African Cantharellus is proposed.},

Corner's book in 1972 on Malaysian boletes. Corner had collected it many times during his tenure in Singapore, and he synonymized Boletus tristis with B. longipes described nine~~years after B. longipes by Patouillard and Baker from the same site. Among the distinguishing characters of B. longipes were deep vinous red spore deposit, red oxidation reaction of the hymenophore when bruised, and spores that displayed a strong violet color reaction in contact with KOH. C.B. Wolfe ultimately moved both species to a new genus Austroboletus. During recent efforts to circumscribe Austroboletus in Australasia using morphological and molecular phylogenetic inferences, it became clear that B. longipes was neither in harmony with Boletus, Porphyrellus, nor Austroboletus. Rather, it is a new genus, which we describe here as Ionosporus, allied to Borofutus, Spongiforma, and Rhodactina of subfamily Leccinoideae. In addition, recent collections from Queensland and New South Wales, Australia, that are morphologically similar to I. longipes, are inferred to be a separate new species, I. australis.},

  abstract = {Plants and their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbionts interact in complex underground networks involving multiple partners. This increases the potential for exploitation and defection by individuals, raising the question of how partners maintain a fair, two-way transfer of resources. We manipulated cooperation in plants and fungal partners to show that plants can detect, discriminate, and reward the best fungal partners with more carbohydrates. In turn, their fungal partners enforce cooperation by increasing nutrient transfer only to those roots providing more carbohydrates. On the basis of these observations we conclude that, unlike many other mutualisms, the symbiont cannot be ``enslaved.'' Rather, the mutualism is evolutionarily stable because control is bidirectional, and partners offering the best rate of exchange are rewarded. Plants and their associated fungi reward partners that offer the best resources to sustain mutualism in complex systems. Plants and their associated fungi reward partners that offer the best resources to sustain mutualism in complex systems.},

  abstract = {DNA sequence alignment algorithms in computational molecular biology have been improved by diverse methods. In this paper, we propose a DNA sequence alignment that uses quality information and a fuzzy inference method developed based on the characteristics of DNA fragments and a fuzzy logic system in order to improve conventional DNA sequence alignment methods that uses DNA sequence quality information. In conventional algorithms, DNA sequence alignment scores are calculated by the global sequence alignment algorithm proposed by Needleman--Wunsch, which is established by using quality information of each DNA fragment. However, there may be errors in the process of calculating DNA sequence alignment scores when the quality of DNA fragment tips is low, because only the overall DNA sequence quality information are used. In our proposed method, an exact DNA sequence alignment can be achieved in spite of the low quality of DNA fragment tips by improvement of conventional algorithms using quality information. Mapping score parameters used to calculate DNA sequence alignment scores are dynamically adjusted by the fuzzy logic system utilizing lengths of DNA fragments and frequencies of low quality DNA bases in the fragments. From the experiments by applying real genome data of National Center for Biotechnology Information, we could see that the proposed method is more efficient than conventional algorithms.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal linkages between turnover of soil microbial communities and their associated functions remain largely unexplored in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet defining these relationships and how they vary across ecosystems and microbial lineages is key to incorporating microbial communities into ecological forecasts and ecosystem models. To define linkages between turnover of soil bacterial and fungal communities and their function we sampled fungal and bacterial composition, abundance, and enzyme activities across a 3-ha area of wet tropical primary forest over 2 yr. We show that fungal and bacterial communities both exhibited temporal turnover, but turnover of both groups was much lower than in temperate ecosystems. Turnover over time was driven by gain and loss of microbial taxa and not changes in abundance of individual species present in multiple samples. Only fungi varied over space with idiosyncratic variation that did not increase linearly with distance among sampling locations. Only phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities were linked to shifts in septate, decomposer fungal abundance; no enzymes were affected by composition or diversity of fungi or bacteria. Although temporal and spatial variation in composition was appreciable, because turnover of microbial communities did not alter the functional repertoire of decomposing enzymes, functional redundancy among taxa may be high in this ecosystem. Slow temporal turnover of tropical soil microbial communities and large functional redundancy suggests that shifts in abundance of particular functional groups may capture ecosystem function more accurately than composition in these heterogeneous ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Eleven species of common fungi from compost were analysed for their content of ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) after growth on agar media. Mean content of ergosterol was 3.1 mg g-1dw of fungal mycelium (range 1--24 mg g-1dw). Total amount of PLFAs varied between 2.6 and 43.5 {$\mu$}molg-1dw of fungi (mean 14.9{$\mu$}molg-1dw). The most common PLFAs were 16:0, 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 and 18:1{$\omega$}9, comprising between 79 and 97mol\% of the total amount of PLFAs. The PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9, suggested as a marker molecule for fungi, comprised between 36 and 61mol\% of the total PLFAs in the Ascomycetes, between 45 and 57mol\% in the Basidiomycetes and 12--22mol\% in the Zygomycetes. There was a good correlation between the content of the two fungal marker molecules, ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9, with a mean content of 1 mg ergosterol being equivalent to 2.1{$\mu$}mol of 18:2{$\omega$}6,9. Based on results from the fungal isolates, conversion factors were calculated (5.4 mg ergosterolg-1 biomass C and 11.8{$\mu$}mol 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 g-1 biomass C) and applied to compost samples in which both the ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9 content had been measured. This resulted in similar estimates of fungal biomass C using the two marker molecules, but was three to five times higher than total microbial biomass C calculated using ATP content in the compost. This could partly be explained by the fact that both of the markers used for fungal biomass are cell membrane constituents. Thus, the ergosterol and the PLFA content were related to the hyphal diameter of the fungi, where fungi with thinner hyphae had higher ergosterol concentrations than fungi with thicker hyphae. This could also partly explain the large interspecific variation in content of the two marker molecules.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are complex adaptive systems that exhibit remarkable feedbacks between their biomass and trait dynamics. Trait-based aggregate models cope with this complexity by focusing on the temporal development of the community's aggregate properties such as its total biomass, mean trait and trait variance. They are based on particular assumptions about the shape of the underlying trait distribution, which is commonly assumed to be normal. However, ecologically important traits are usually restricted to a finite range, and empirical trait distributions are often skewed or multimodal. As a result, normal distribution-based aggregate models may fail to adequately represent the biomass and trait dynamics of natural communities. We resolve this mismatch by developing a new moment closure approach assuming the trait values to be beta-distributed. We show that the beta distribution captures important shape properties of both observed and simulated trait distributions, which cannot be captured by a Gaussian. We further demonstrate that a beta distribution-based moment closure can strongly enhance the reliability of trait-based aggregate models. We compare the biomass, mean trait and variance dynamics of a full trait distribution (FD) model to the ones of beta (BA) and normal (NA) distribution-based aggregate models, under different selection regimes. This way, we demonstrate under which general conditions (stabilizing, fluctuating or disruptive selection) different aggregate models are reliable tools. All three models predicted very similar biomass and trait dynamics under stabilizing selection yielding unimodal trait distributions with small standing trait variation. We also obtained an almost perfect match between the results of the FD and BA models under fluctuating selection, promoting skewed trait distributions and ongoing oscillations in the biomass and trait dynamics. In contrast, the NA model showed unrealistic trait dynamics and exhibited different alternative stable states, and thus a high sensitivity to initial conditions under fluctuating selection. Under disruptive selection, both aggregate models failed to reproduce the results of the FD model with the mean trait values remaining within their ecologically feasible ranges in the BA model but not in the NA model. Overall, a beta distribution-based moment closure strongly improved the realism of trait-based aggregate models.},

  abstract = {In tropical and subtropical rainforests, vegetative fungal rhizomorphs from the Marasmiineae are routinely used as construction material in bird nests. Because rhizomorphs seldom produce mushrooms within nests, the fungal species involved remain largely unknown. In turn, this limitation has prevented us from resolving broader questions such as whether specific fungal species are selected by birds for different functional roles (i.e., attachment, or parasite control). To fill some of these gaps, we collected 74 rhizomorph-containing bird nests from the Neo- and Afrotropics and used nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) sequences to discriminate between rhizomorph-forming species. In total we recovered 25 Marasmiineae species used by birds in nest construction, none of which were shared between the Neotropics and the Afrotropics. We also collected Marasmiineae basidiomes in the vicinity of nests and used ITS sequences to match these sporulating morphs with nest rhizomorphs for nine species. Basidiomes from an additional five species were found fruiting from rhizomorphs incorporated within bird nests. Finally, an additional six species were putatively identified based on publicly available sequence data. Rhizomorphs of five species were found to be utilized almost exclusively as lining material in nests. Lining material comes in direct contact with nestlings and is hypothesized to play a role in parasite control. Rhizomorphs from 10 species were used to attach and anchor nests to substrates; we matched six of those to fruiting litter trap-forming species collected in the understory. Litter traps hold large quantities of fallen litter material, suggesting that birds may preferentially use rhizomorphs that are adapted to bearing heavy loads for nest attachment. Finally, we describe two species of Marasmius---M. neocrinis-equi, sp. nov., and M. nidus-avis, sp. nov.---that are commonly found associated with bird nests and show that rhizomorph production is common across the genus.},

  abstract = {Phylogenomic subsampling is a procedure by which small sets of loci are selected from large genome-scale datasets and used for phylogenetic inference. This step is often motivated by either computational limitations associated with the use of complex inference methods, or as a means of testing the robustness of phylogenetic results by discarding loci that are deemed potentially misleading. Although many alternative methods of phylogenomic subsampling have been proposed, little effort has gone into comparing their behavior across different datasets. Here, I calculate multiple gene properties for a range of phylogenomic datasets spanning animal, fungal and plant clades, uncovering a remarkable predictability in their patterns of covariance. I also show how these patterns provide a means for ordering loci by both their rate of evolution and their relative phylogenetic usefulness. This method of retrieving phylogenetically useful loci is found to be among the top performing when compared to alternative subsampling protocols. Relatively common approaches such as minimizing potential sources of systematic bias or increasing the clock-likeness of the data are found to fare worse than selecting loci at random. Likewise, the general utility of rate-based subsampling is found to be limited: loci evolving at both low and high rates are among the least effective, and even those evolving at optimal rates can still widely differ in usefulness. This study shows that many common subsampling approaches introduce unintended effects in off-target gene properties, and proposes an alternative multivariate method that simultaneously optimizes phylogenetic signal while controlling for known sources of bias.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus is one of the economically most important fungal genera. Recently, the ICN adopted the single name nomenclature which has forced mycologists to choose one name for fungi (e.g. Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, etc.). Previously two proposals for the single name nomenclature in Aspergillus were presented: one attributes the name ``Aspergillus'' to clades comprising seven different teleomorphic names, by supporting the monophyly of this genus; the other proposes that Aspergillus is a non-monophyletic genus, by preserving the Aspergillus name only to species belonging to subgenus Circumdati and maintaining the sexual names in the other clades. The aim of our study was to test the monophyly of Aspergilli by two independent phylogenetic analyses using a multilocus phylogenetic approach. One test was run on the publicly available coding regions of six genes (RPB1, RPB2, Tsr1, Cct8, BenA, CaM), using 96 species of Penicillium, Aspergillus and related taxa. Bayesian (MrBayes) and Ultrafast Maximum Likelihood (IQ-Tree) and Rapid Maximum Likelihood (RaxML) analyses gave the same conclusion highly supporting the monophyly of Aspergillus. The other analyses were also performed by using publicly available data of the coding sequences of nine loci (18S rRNA, 5,8S rRNA, 28S rRNA (D1-D2), RPB1, RPB2, CaM, BenA, Tsr1, Cct8) of 204 different species. Both Bayesian (MrBayes) and Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) trees obtained by this second round of independent analyses strongly supported the monophyly of the genus Aspergillus. The stability test also confirmed the robustness of the results obtained. In conclusion, statistical analyses have rejected the hypothesis that the Aspergilli are non-monophyletic, and provided robust arguments that the genus is monophyletic and clearly separated from the monophyletic genus Penicillium. There is no phylogenetic evidence to split Aspergillus into several genera and the name Aspergillus can be used for all the species belonging to Aspergillus i.e. the clade comprising the subgenera Aspergillus, Circumdati, Fumigati, Nidulantes, section Cremei and certain species which were formerly part of the genera Phialosimplex and Polypaecilum. Section Cremei and the clade containing Polypaecilum and Phialosimplex are proposed as new subgenera of Aspergillus. The phylogenetic analysis also clearly shows that Aspergillus clavatoflavus and A.~zonatus do not belong to the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillus clavatoflavus is therefore transferred to a new genus Aspergillago as Aspergillago clavatoflavus and A.~zonatus was transferred to Penicilliopsis as P.~zonata. The subgenera of Aspergillus share similar extrolite profiles indicating that the genus is one large genus from a chemotaxonomical point of view. Morphological and ecophysiological characteristics of the species also strongly indicate that Aspergillus is a polythetic class in phenotypic characters.},

  abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is a popular barcode marker for fungi and in particular the ITS1 has been widely used for the anaerobic fungi (phylum Neocallimastigomycota). A good number of validated reference sequences of isolates as well as a large number of environmental sequences are available in public databases. Its highly variable nature predisposes the ITS1 for low level phylogenetics; however, it complicates the establishment of reproducible alignments and the reconstruction of stable phylogenetic trees at higher taxonomic levels (genus and above). Here, we overcame these problems by proposing a common core secondary structure of the ITS1 of the anaerobic fungi employing a Hidden Markov Model-based ITS1 sequence annotation and a helix-wise folding approach. We integrated the additional structural information into phylogenetic analyses and present for the first time an automated sequence-structure-based taxonomy of the ITS1 of the anaerobic fungi. The methodology developed is transferable to the ITS1 of other fungal groups, and the robust taxonomy will facilitate and improve high-throughput anaerobic fungal community structure analysis of samples from various environments.},

Paradoxically, these successes of modern medicine have given rise to large groups of people at risk for fungal infections. Life-saving treatments may now breach normal immune functions, or susceptible patients such as premature newborns now survive long enough to become infected by a fungus. Invasive fungal infections have been very rare over most of our species' history (1), and the fungi that infect healthy humans are a small, if fascinating, group. Many more invasive fungal infections now occur in patients with an underlying serious illness.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest amongst community ecologists in functional traits. Response traits determine membership in communities. Effect traits influence ecosystem function. One goal of community ecology is to predict the effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Environmental change can directly and indirectly affect ecosystem function. Indirect effects are mediated through shifts in community structure. It is difficult to predict how environmental change will affect ecosystem function via the indirect route when the change in effect trait distribution is not predictable from the change in response trait distribution. When response traits function as effect traits, however, it becomes possible to predict the indirect effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Here we illustrate four examples in which key attributes of ectomycorrhizal fungi function as both response and effect traits. While plant ecologists have discussed response and effect traits in the context of community structuring and ecosystem function, this approach has not been applied to ectomycorrhizal fungi. This is unfortunate because of the large effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi on ecosystem function. We hope to stimulate further research in this area in the hope of better predicting the ecosystem- and landscape-level effects of the fungi as influenced by changing environmental conditions.},

However, the use of molecular phylogenetics has become increasingly common in the identification of fungal endophytes, and during the period of 2007--2010 there were approximately 200 publications that reported data obtained using this approach. This new methodology involves using sequence data from isolates or whole DNA from plant substrates, which are amplified using fungus- specific primers. The data obtained are compared with sequences downloaded from public databases such as GenBank and then used to construct phylogenetic trees. The major problem with this approach is that much of the sequence data in these databases has been shown to be from isolates that were incorrectly named. In some species, as much as 86\% of the sequences available are not from the organism whose name has been applied to the sequence in question. The use of these GenBank sequences to identify endophytic isolates by sequence similarity simply perpetuates the problem of wrong species identification, and any lists of endophytes established by such methods are likely to be highly erroneous. It is recommended that comparisons of sequence data be made using sequences from type species, and if such sequences are not available, then the data must be treated with caution.},

To overcome this obstacle, we have developed an approach to sequence an AMF marker within the ribosome-encoding operon (rDNA) that covers all three widely applied variable molecular markers. Using a nested PCR approach specific to AMF, we amplified a part (c. 2.5 kb) of the rDNA spanning the majority of the small subunit rRNA (SSU) gene, the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and a part of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene. The PCR products were sequenced on the PacBio platform utilizing Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing. Employing this method for selected environmental DNA samples, we were able to describe complex AMF communities consisting of various glomeromycotan lineages. We demonstrate the applicability of this new 2.5 kb approach to provide robust phylogenetic assignment of AMF lineages without known sequences from pure cultures and to consolidate information about AMF taxon distributions coming from three widely used barcoding regions into one integrative dataset.},

  abstract = {Here, we describe the taxon hypothesis (TH) paradigm, which covers the construction, identification, and communication of taxa as datasets. Defining taxa as datasets of individuals and their traits will make taxon identification and most importantly communication of taxa precise and reproducible. This will allow datasets with standardized and atomized traits to be used digitally in identification pipelines and communicated through persistent identifiers. Such datasets are particularly useful in the context of formally undescribed or even physically undiscovered species if data such as sequences from samples of environmental DNA (eDNA) are available. Implementing the TH paradigm will to some extent remove the impediment to hastily discover and formally describe all extant species in that the TH paradigm allows discovery and communication of new species and other taxa also in the absence of formal descriptions. The TH datasets can be connected to a taxonomic backbone providing access to the vast information associated with the tree of life. In parallel to the description of the TH paradigm, we demonstrate how it is implemented in the UNITE digital taxon communication system. UNITE TH datasets include rich data on individuals and their rDNA ITS sequences. These datasets are equipped with digital object identifiers (DOI) that serve to fix their identity in our communication. All datasets are also connected to a GBIF taxonomic backbone. Researchers processing their eDNA samples using UNITE datasets will, thus, be able to publish their findings as taxon occurrences in the GBIF data portal. UNITE species hypothesis (species level THs) datasets are increasingly utilized in taxon identification pipelines and even formally undescribed species can be identified and communicated by using UNITE. The TH paradigm seeks to achieve unambiguous, unique, and traceable communication of taxa and their properties at any level of the tree of life. It offers a rapid way to discover and communicate undescribed species in identification pipelines and data portals before they are lost to the sixth mass extinction.},

Using ethnomycological surveys all over the Ivorian territory, information was collected from rural populations on the fructification of Termitomyces and their socio-economic importance. Based on these surveys, sampling efforts of these fungi were properly structured and oriented. The results revealed a diversity of 16 species of Termitomyces, including 9 species new to C{\^o}te d'Ivoire and 2 probably new to science. Five species were found in the forest zone, nine in theGuinean savannah zone and four in the Sudano-Guinean zone. Termitomyces's fructifications were observed throughout the year, with specific period for each species. All listed species are regularly consumed by populations. However, only Termitomyces letestui (Pat.) R. Heim and Termitomyces schimperi (Pat.) R. Heim are marketed on a relatively large scale.},

  abstract = {Molecular sequences in public databases are mostly annotated by the submitting authors without further validation. This procedure can generate erroneous taxonomic sequence labels. Mislabeled sequences are hard to identify, and they can induce downstream errors because new sequences are typically annotated using existing ones. Furthermore, taxonomic mislabelings in reference sequence databases can bias metagenetic studies which rely on the taxonomy. Despite significant efforts to improve the quality of taxonomic annotations, the curation rate is low because of the labor-intensive manual curation process. Here, we present SATIVA, a phylogeny-aware method to automatically identify taxonomically mislabeled sequences (`mislabels') using statistical models of evolution. We use the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) to detect and score sequences whose taxonomic annotation is not supported by the underlying phylogenetic signal, and automatically propose a corrected taxonomic classification for those. Using simulated data, we show that our method attains high accuracy for identification (96.9\% sensitivity/91.7\% precision) as well as correction (94.9\% sensitivity/89.9\% precision) of mislabels. Furthermore, an analysis of four widely used microbial 16S reference databases (Greengenes, LTP, RDP and SILVA) indicates that they currently contain between 0.2\% and 2.5\% mislabels. Finally, we use SATIVA to perform an in-depth evaluation of alternative taxonomies for Cyanobacteria. SATIVA is freely available at https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa.},

  abstract = {Phylogenies are important for fundamental biological research, but also have numerous applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. Finding the optimal tree under the popular maximum likelihood (ML) criterion is known to be NP-hard. Thus, highly optimized and scalable codes are needed to analyze constantly growing empirical datasets.We present RAxML-NG, a from-scratch re-implementation of the established greedy tree search algorithm of RAxML/ExaML. RAxML-NG offers improved accuracy, flexibility, speed, scalability, and usability compared with RAxML/ExaML. On taxon-rich datasets, RAxML-NG typically finds higher-scoring trees than IQTree, an increasingly popular recent tool for ML-based phylogenetic inference (although IQ-Tree shows better stability). Finally, RAxML-NG introduces several new features, such as the detection of terraces in tree space and the recently introduced transfer bootstrap support metric.The code is available under GNU GPL at https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng.

  abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

While global temperatures increase, associated changes in the fruiting behaviour of fungi remain unknown. Here, we analyse 6.1 million fungal fruit body (mushroom) records and show that the major terrestrial biomes exhibit similarities and differences in fruiting events. We observed one main fruiting peak in most years across all biomes. However, in boreal and temperate biomes, there was a substantial number of years with a second peak, indicating spring and autumn fruiting. Distinct fruiting peaks are spatially synchronized in boreal and temperate biomes, but less defined and longer in the humid tropics. The timing and duration of fungal fruiting were significantly related to temperature mean and variability. Temperature-dependent aboveground fungal fruiting behaviour, which is arguably also representative of belowground processes, suggests that the observed biome-specific differences in fungal phenology will change in space and time when global temperatures continue to increase.},

  abstract = {In light of the current biodiversity crisis, DNA barcoding is developing into an essential tool to quantify state shifts in global ecosystems. Current barcoding protocols often rely on short amplicon sequences, which yield accurate identification of biological entities in a community but provide limited phylogenetic resolution across broad taxonomic scales. However, the phylogenetic structure of communities is an essential component of biodiversity. Consequently, a barcoding approach is required that unites robust taxonomic assignment power and high phylogenetic utility. A possible solution is offered by sequencing long ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons on the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).Using a dataset of various animal and plant species, with a focus on arthropods, we assemble a pipeline for long rDNA barcode analysis and introduce a new software (MiniBar) to demultiplex dual indexed Nanopore reads. We find excellent phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution offered by long rDNA sequences across broad taxonomic scales. We highlight the simplicity of our approach by field barcoding with a miniaturized, mobile laboratory in a remote rainforest. We also test the utility of long rDNA amplicons for analysis of community diversity through metabarcoding and find that they recover highly skewed diversity estimates.Sequencing dual indexed, long rDNA amplicons on the MinION platform is a straightforward, cost-effective, portable, and universal approach for eukaryote DNA barcoding. Although bulk community analyses using long-amplicon approaches may introduce biases, the long rDNA amplicons approach signifies a powerful tool for enabling the accurate recovery of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity across biological communities.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the {$\alpha$}-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.},

  abstract = {Fruiting body formation in Agaricomycetes (Agaricomycotina) represents the most complex developmental processes known in the fungal kingdom. Shapes range from simple resupinate forms with open hymenia through to closed puff-balls and false truffles with internally hidden hymenia and include brackets and stiped mushrooms, which may have open caps throughout or which open during development, where the hymenia cover the surfaces of gills or pores. Mushroom shapes and features do not necessarily reflect close or distant phylogenetic relationships. Thus, morphological characteristics have lost some of their former significance in taxonomy. The onset and progress of courses of processes in mushroom formation are determined by the sum of various genetic, physiological and environmental factors. Shapes of mushrooms can be dramatically changed by mutations and by adverse environmental conditions. Events in normal fruiting body formation may run in parallel or behind each other in the form of `subroutines' that have different degrees of independency to each other. Alterations in details or in places and orders of distinct subroutines and omissions can result in abnormal mushrooms. Developmental processes, time courses and tissue structures have been described in more details for a few model species (such as the hemiangiocarpous Coprinopsis cinerea and the gymnocarpous Schizophyllum commune) and some species of commercial interest (e.g. the gymnocarpous Auricularia auricula-judae and the hemiangiocarpous Agaricus bisporus). Morphological descriptions of fruiting body development in these four species are summarized here. Agaricomycetes have relatively large genomes with more than 10,000 different genes, many of which are expressed during the fruiting process in specific pseudoparenchymatous tissues (plectenchyma) or possibly only in individual cells within a tissue and at specific times. To understand the distinct functions of all these genes in space and time will require very fine dissection and analysis of distinct mushroom tissues and cells in future studies.},

  abstract = {Fungi do not have different sexes characterized by specific morphological organs but control sexual development by physiological differences defined by mating types. While other lineages in the fungal kingdom have only two distinct mating types, multiple mating types are common in the Basidiomycetes, presumably for outcomes related to enhanced outbreeding. Mating types in Basidiomycetes are determined by genes that encode two types of homeodomain transcription factors (HD genes) and by genes that encode lipopeptide pheromones and pheromone receptors (PR genes). In the tetrapolar mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea, these genes reside at two distinct loci on different chromosomes and regulate distinct steps in dikaryon formation and maintenance and fruiting body formation for sexual reproduction by controlling the expression of large sets of genes. The matA (HD) locus in C. cinerea has an estimated 160 alleles in nature, and the matB (PR) locus has 79. The respective products of both loci interact with each other in a lock-and-key manner. Proteins encoded in allelic sets of mating type genes recognize each other and interact in order to either form a functional transcription factor complex that is transported into the nucleus (matA proteins) or to initiate a pheromone response signaling cascade (matB proteins). Products encoded by the same matA or matB allele do not interact, which is crucial to the functionality of the two systems controlling sexual development. Multiple alleles of mating type genes arose in evolution through the evolution of distinct DNA sequences and the resulting encoded proteins perform the tasks of recognition and discrimination. In a second modus of multiplication, paralogous sets of HD and PR genes evolved by gene duplications and subsequent sequence diversification in order to mediate functional independency and respective allele variation. In C. cinerea, there are thus three paralogous groups of functional mating type genes at both the matA and the matB locus. Because groups of paralogous genes are freely interchangeable, only a few alleles of each of the actual gene groups (between 2 and 9 are known per group) are required to generate the large number of distinct matA and matB mating types found in nature. As deduced from the ever increasing number of genome projects, the basic principles of evolution of multiple mating types as unraveled in C. cinerea by Lorna A. Casselton and her coworkers are to different degrees also operative in other mushroom species.},

  abstract = {Phlebopus portentosus is one of the most popular wild edible mushrooms in Thailand and can produce sporocarps in the culture without a host plant. However, it is still unclear whether Phlebopus portentosus is a saprotrophic, parasitic, or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus. In this study, Phlebopus portentosus sporocarps were collected from northern Thailand and identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics. We combined mycorrhizal synthesis and stable isotopic analysis to investigate the trophic status of this fungus. In a greenhouse experiment, ECM-like structures were observed in Pinus kesiya at 1 year after inoculation with fungal mycelium, and the association of Phlebopus portentosus and other plant species showed superficial growth over the root surface. Fungus-colonized root tips were described morphologically and colonization confirmed by molecular methods. In stable isotope measurements, the {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N of natural samples of Phlebopus portentosus differed from saprotrophic fungi. Based on the isotopic patterns of Phlebopus portentosus and its ability to form ECM-like structures in greenhouse experiments, we conclude that Phlebopus portentosus could be an ECM fungus.},

  abstract = {Summary Massively parallel pyrosequencing of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene has revealed that the extent of rare microbial populations in several environments, the ?rare biosphere?, is orders of magnitude higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates. Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have been reported. Using only Escherichia coli MG1655 as a reference template, we find that 16S rDNA diversity is grossly overestimated unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore, common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation. We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

Two DNA data sets (combined 28S-TEF1 and 28S-TEF1-RPB2), comprising sequences from nearly 270 voucher specimens, were evaluated using two different phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference). Five major clades were obtained, and leccinoid fungi appeared in four of them.

  abstract = {Apicomplexa is a group of obligate intracellular parasites that includes the causative agents of human diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexans evolved from free-living phototrophic ancestors, but how this transition to parasitism occurred remains unknown. One potential clue lies in coral reefs, of which environmental DNA surveys have uncovered several lineages of uncharacterized basally branching apicomplexans1,2. Reef-building corals have a well-studied symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates (for example, Symbiodinium3), but the identification of other key microbial symbionts of corals has proven to be challenging4,5. Here we use community surveys, genomics and microscopy analyses to identify an apicomplexan lineage---which we informally name `corallicolids'---that was found at a high prevalence (over~80\% of samples, 70\% of genera) across all major groups of corals. Corallicolids were the second most abundant coral-associated microeukaryotes after the Symbiodiniaceae, and are therefore core members of the coral microbiome. In situ fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed that corallicolids live intracellularly within the tissues of the coral gastric cavity, and that they possess apicomplexan ultrastructural features. We sequenced the genome of the corallicolid plastid, which lacked all genes for photosystem proteins; this indicates that corallicolids probably contain a non-photosynthetic plastid (an apicoplast6). However, the corallicolid plastid differs from all other known apicoplasts because it retains the four ancestral genes that are involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Corallicolids thus share characteristics with both their parasitic and their free-living relatives, which suggests that they are evolutionary intermediates and implies the existence of a unique biochemistry during the transition from phototrophy to parasitism.},

Soil microorganisms play a central role as mediators of these interactions, but mechanistic understanding is still largely lacking. Correlative data from a coniferous forest ecosystem support the hypothesis that interactions between fungal guilds play a central role in regulating organic matter accumulation in relation to fertility. With increasing ecosystem fertility, the proportion of saprotrophic basidiomycetes increased in deeper organic layers, at the expense of ectomycorrhizal fungal species. Saprotrophs correlated positively with the activity of oxidative enzymes, which in turn favoured organic matter turnover and nitrogen recycling to plants. Combined, our findings are consistent with a fungus-mediated feedback loop, which results in a negative correlation between ecosystem fertility and below-ground carbon storage. These findings call for a shift in focus from plant litter traits to fungal traits in explaining organic matter dynamics and ecosystem fertility in boreal forests.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Indels (insertions/deletions) are important DNA sequence variations because of the high frequency in the human genome, the deleterious effects on the reading frame and protein expression, and the association with disease and disease susceptibility of common diseases. In a recent study with a human individual with the whole genome sequenced, 292,102 heterozygous indels and 559,473 homozygous indels were identified. Decrypting such a large number of heterozygous indels is computationally intensive and requires efficient algorithms. However, the current algorithms for decrypting heterozygous indel cannot be applied to unprecedented sequenced genomes and cannot be performed without reference sequences or reference sequence tracings for sequenced genomes. Methods: A new algorithm for de novo decrypting of heterozygous indels is conceptualized in the direction of isolating the indel sequence from the genotype or diploid sequence. A universal algorithm is described, here, for heterozygous indel detection, indel size determination, and de novo decrypting of the indel sequence without subtracting the diploid DNA sequence from the reference sequence or reference sequence tracing. Results: The result obtained by this algorithm is exactly the same as that obtained by PolyPhred and PolyScan. Unlike these algorithms, this new algorithm is not computationally intense for large indels, is independent of sequencing technologies and applies to genotype data derived from all existing sequencing technology platforms. A read of only 29 bases is enough to reduce the false detection rate (FDR) to 1 in a million. Conclusions: This algorithm is unique amongst all the existing algorithms in terms of performing the task of indel detection, size determination, and decrypting simultaneously. This universal approach eliminates the requirement of a reference sequence or sequence tracing and makes this algorithm unique in decrypting unprecedented sequenced genomes. Because of the high frequency of heterozygous indels in human genome, this universal algorithm will greatly reduce the time required for post-sequencing data analysis in whole genome sequencing of an individual for the practice of personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a powerful statistical approach for the testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical causal relationships in complex data sets with intercorrelated dependent and independent variables. SEM is commonly applied in ecology, but the spatial information commonly found in ecological data remains difficult to model in a SEM framework. Here we propose a simple method for spatially explicit SEM (SE-SEM) based on the analysis of variance/covariance matrices calculated across a range of lag distances. This method provides readily interpretable plots of the change in path coefficients across scale and can be implemented using any standard SEM software package. We demonstrate the application of this method using three studies examining the relationships between environmental factors, plant community structure, nitrogen fixation, and plant competition. By design, these data sets had a spatial component, but were previously analyzed using standard SEM models. Using these data sets, we demonstrate the application of SE-SEM to regularly spaced, irregularly spaced, and ad hoc spatial sampling designs and discuss the increased inferential capability of this approach compared with standard SEM. We provide an R package, sesem, to easily implement spatial structural equation modeling.},

  abstract = {We present Genozip, a universal and fully featured compression software for genomic data. Genozip is designed to be a general-purpose software and a development framework for genomic compression by providing five core capabilities---universality (support for all common genomic file formats), high compression ratios, speed, feature-richness and extensibility. Genozip delivers high-performance compression for widelyused genomic data formats in genomics research, namely FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF, GVF, FASTA, PHYLIP and 23andMe formats. Our test results show that Genozip is fast and achieves greatly improved compression ratios, even when the files are already compressed. Further, Genozip is architected with a separation of the Genozip Framework from file-format-specific Segmenters and data-type-specific Codecs. With this, we intend for Genozip to be a general-purpose compression platform where researchers can implement compression for additional file formats, as well as new codecs for data types or fields within files, in the future. We anticipate that this will ultimately increase the visibility and adoption of these algorithms by the user community, thereby accelerating further innovation in this space.Genozip is written in C. The code is open-source and available on http://www.genozip.com. The package is free for non-commercial use. It is distributed through the Conda package manager, github, and as a Docker container on DockerHub. Genozip is tested on Linux, Mac and Windows.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequence data, partitioning involves estimating independent models of molecular evolution for different sets of sites in a sequence alignment. Choosing an appropriate partitioning scheme is an important step in most analyses because it can affect the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. Despite this, partitioning schemes are often chosen without explicit statistical justification. Here, we describe two new objective methods for the combined selection of best-fit partitioning schemes and nucleotide substitution models. These methods allow millions of partitioning schemes to be compared in realistic time frames and so permit the objective selection of partitioning schemes even for large multilocus DNA data sets. We demonstrate that these methods significantly outperform previous approaches, including both the ad hoc selection of partitioning schemes (e.g., partitioning by gene or codon position) and a recently proposed hierarchical clustering method. We have implemented these methods in an open-source program, PartitionFinder. This program allows users to select partitioning schemes and substitution models using a range of information-theoretic metrics (e.g., the Bayesian information criterion, akaike information criterion [AIC], and corrected AIC). We hope that PartitionFinder will encourage the objective selection of partitioning schemes and thus lead to improvements in phylogenetic analyses. PartitionFinder is written in Python and runs under Mac OSX 10.4 and above. The program, source code, and a detailed manual are freely available from www.robertlanfear.com/partitionfinder.},

Both partners benefit from the relationship: mycorrhizal fungi improve the fitness of their host plants by influencing mineral nutrition and water absorption and by increasing tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The host plant rewards the fungal symbiont with carbon compounds derived from the photosynthetic process (1).},

Modeling their RNA structure also remains particularly challenging for organelle sequences, owing to their great diversity. In fact, accelerated evolution in organelles often results in a reduced RNA structure and a loss of autocatalytic splicing and intron mobility. We set out to identify all mitochondrial group I and II introns in published sequences, and, to this end, we developed and applied a new search approach: RNAweasel. On the basis of the results, we focus here on building a comprehensive picture of mitochondrial group I introns, including a modified (reduced) consensus RNA secondary structure and a concise phylogeny-based subclassification.}

  abstract = {Compared to nuclear genomes, mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are small and usually code for only a few dozen genes. Still, identifying genes and their structure can be challenging and time-consuming. Even automated tools for mitochondrial genome annotation often require manual analysis and curation by skilled experts. The most difficult steps are (i) the structural modelling of intron-containing genes; (ii) the identification and delineation of Group I and II introns; and (iii) the identification of moderately conserved, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes specifying 5S rRNAs, tmRNAs and RNase P RNAs. Additional challenges arise through genetic code evolution which can redefine the translational identity of both start and stop codons, thus obscuring protein-coding genes. Further, RNA editing can render gene identification difficult, if not impossible, without additional RNA sequence data. Current automated mito- and plastid-genome annotators are limited as they are typically tailored to specific eukaryotic groups. The MFannot annotator we developed is unique in its applicability to a broad taxonomic scope, its accuracy in gene model inference, and its capabilities in intron identification and classification. The pipeline leverages curated profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), covariance (CMs) and ERPIN models to better capture evolutionarily conserved signatures in the primary sequence (HMMs and CMs) as well as secondary structure (CMs and ERPIN). Here we formally describe MFannot, which has been available as a web-accessible service (https://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/apps/mfannot/) to the research community for nearly 16 years. Further, we report its performance on particularly intron-rich mitogenomes and describe ongoing and future developments.},

  abstract = {Sequencing of taxonomic or phylogenetic markers is becoming a fast and efficient method for studying environmental microbial communities. This has resulted in a steadily growing collection of marker sequences, most notably of the small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene, and an increased understanding of microbial phylogeny, diversity and community composition patterns. However, to utilize these large datasets together with new sequencing technologies, a reliable and flexible system for taxonomic classification is critical. We developed CREST (Classification Resources for Environmental Sequence Tags), a set of resources and tools for generating and utilizing custom taxonomies and reference datasets for classification of environmental sequences. CREST uses an alignment-based classification method with the lowest common ancestor algorithm. It also uses explicit rank similarity criteria to reduce false positives and identify novel taxa. We implemented this method in a web server, a command line tool and the graphical user interfaced program MEGAN. Further, we provide the SSU rRNA reference database and taxonomy SilvaMod, derived from the publicly available SILVA SSURef, for classification of sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Using cross-validation and environmental datasets, we compared the performance of CREST and SilvaMod to the RDP Classifier. We also utilized Greengenes as a reference database, both with CREST and the RDP Classifier. These analyses indicate that CREST performs better than alignment-free methods with higher recall rate (sensitivity) as well as precision, and with the ability to accurately identify most sequences from novel taxa. Classification using SilvaMod performed better than with Greengenes, particularly when applied to environmental sequences.

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is now routinely used in phylogenomics and, more generally, in macro-evolutionary studies. Beyond the philosophical debates it has raised concerning the choice of the prior and the meaning of posterior probabilities, Bayesian inference, combined with generic Monte Carlo algorithms, offers a flexible framework for introducing subjective or context information through the prior, but also, for designing hierarchical models formalizing complex patterns of variation (across sites or branches) or the integration of multiple levels of evolutionary processes. In this chapter, the principles of Bayesian inference, such as applied to phylogenetic reconstruction , are first introduced, with an emphasis on the key features of the Bayesian paradigm that explain its flexibility in terms of model design and its robustness in inferring complex patterns and processes. A more specific focus is then put on the question of modeling pattern-heterogeneity across sites, using both parametric and non-parametric random-effect models. Finally, the current computational challenges are discussed.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing-based analysis of microbial diversity has evolved vastly over the last decade. Currently, the go-to method for studying microbial eukaryotes is short-read metabarcoding of variable regions of the 18S rRNA gene with {$<$}500 bp amplicons. However, there is a growing interest in applying long-read sequencing of amplicons covering the rRNA operon for improving taxonomic resolution. For both methods, the choice of primers is crucial. It determines if community members are covered, if they can be identified at a satisfactory taxonomic level, and if the obtained community profile is representative. Here, we designed new primers targeting 18S and 28S rRNA based on 177,934 and 21,072 database sequences, respectively. The primers were evaluated in silico along with published primers on reference sequence databases and marine metagenomics data sets. We further evaluated a subset of the primers for short- and long-read sequencing on environmental samples in vitro and compared the obtained community profile with primer-unbiased metagenomic sequencing. Of the short-read pairs, a new V6-V8 pair and the V4\_Balzano pair used with a simplified PCR protocol provided good results in silico and in vitro. Fewer differences were observed between the long-read primer pairs. The long-read amplicons and ITS1 alone provided higher taxonomic resolution than V4. Together, our results represent a reference and guide for selection of robust primers for research on and environmental monitoring of microbial eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Cryptomycota is a newly discovered phylum of early-diverging fungi that is estimated to comprise a massive amount of unstudied biodiversity. Known primarily from environmental DNA sequences, the group contains few formally described and successfully cultured genera, all known as obligate endoparasites. Numerous studies have detected Cryptomycota as DNA sequences in aquatic, terrestrial, and animal associated habitats, though no study to date has specifically targeted the group by PCR. In this study, we developed Cryptomycota-specific and preferential primers for the 18S rRNA gene in order to facilitate studies on the biodiversity and ecology of the group. The diversity of sequences and habitat association of Cryptomycota was surveyed across three environments: freshwater sediment, marine sediment, and soil. The new primers were able to recover a large proportion of Cryptomycota sequences: of 56 sequences cloned or directly sequenced, 44 were unique OTUs and (39/44) 88.6~\% were phylogenetically affiliated with Cryptomycota. This study expands the boundary of current Cryptomycota sequence diversity; unique Cryptomycota OTUs were spread across six of 12 supported Cryptomycota sub clades. Freshwater sediments and soil were consistently amplified with the Cryptomycota-preferential primers. Our results suggest that Cryptomycota are ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse components of essentially all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whose ecological functions should be better explored.},

Australasian and Japanese species of Chamonixia were examined using morphological and molecular (ITS and nLSU rDNA) data and found to also have affinities with Leccinum and Leccinellum, however they form a distinct clade separate from the European type species C. caespitosa Rolland and North American species. A new genus, Rosbeeva T.Lebel \& Orihara gen. nov., is proposed for the Australasian, Japanese and Chinese taxa. The species R. mucosa (Petri) T.Lebel comb. nov. is restricted in distribution to Singapore and Borneo, and R. pachyderma (Zeller \& C.W. Dodge) T.Lebel comb. nov. to New Zealand, with Australian collections considered to belong to a revised R. vittatispora (G.W.Beaton, Pegler \& T.W.K.Young) T.Lebel comb. nov. or a new species R. westraliensis T. Lebel sp. nov. The Chinese species R. bispora (B.C.Zhang \& Y.N.Yu) T.Lebel \& Orihara comb. nov is transferred to the new genus based upon morphological data. Two new species from Japan, Rosbeeva eucyanea Orihara and R. griseovelutina Orihara, are also described and illustrated. A key to all species of Rosbeeva is provided. Due to the highly modified gastroid sporocarp forms of both Chamonixia and Rosbeeva, many macroscopic characters of use in agaricoid taxonomy are difficult to interpret. However, color change and texture of sporocarps are of some use to distinguish genera and species. Microscopic characters such as spore shape, dimensions, and ornamentation, and pileipellis and hymenophoral trama structure, are essential for determining genera and species.},

The classical dynamic programming algorithm aligns two sequences by optimizing over possible insertions, deletions and substitutions. However, other evolutionary events can be observed, such as inversions, tandem duplications or moves (transpositions). It has been established that the extension of the problem to move operations is NP-complete. Previous work has shown that an extension restricted to non-overlapping inversions can be solved in O(n 3) with a restricted scoring scheme. In this paper, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves can be solved in O(n 5) for general scoring schemes, O(n 4log n) for concave scoring schemes and O(n 4) for restricted scoring schemes. Furthermore, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves, inversions and tandem duplications can be solved with the same time complexities. Finally, an example of an alignment with non-overlapping moves is provided.},

However, this leads to loss of information needed for accurate alignment, and gap scoring artifacts.Results: We present a graph representation of an MSA that can itself be aligned directly by pairwise dynamic programming, eliminating the need to reduce the MSA to a profile. This enables our algorithm (Partial Order Alignment (POA)) to guarantee that the optimal alignment of each new sequence versus each sequence in the MSA will be considered. Moreover, this algorithm introduces a new edit operator, homologous recombination, important for multidomain sequences. The algorithm has improved speed (linear time complexity) over existing MSA algorithms, enabling construction of massive and complex alignments (e.g. an alignment of 5000 sequences in 4 h on a Pentium II). We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm on a family of multidomain SH2 proteins, and on EST assemblies containing alternative splicing and polymorphism.Availability: The partial order alignment program POA is available at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa.Contact: leec@mbi.ucla.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.2Current address: center for Applied Mathematics, 657 Rhodes Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853, USA.},

Although the genus has been well-studied in Europe and North America, only fragmentary researches have been carried out on Asian species. In particular, the distribution of Lactarius species in South Korea is poorly understood due to insufficient morphological descriptions and a lack of DNA sequence data. In addition, the misuse of European and North American names has added to confusion regarding the taxonomy of Asian Lactarius species. In this study, the diversity of Lactarius in South Korea was evaluated by employing both morphological and phylogenetic approaches. A multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of 729 Lactarius specimens collected between 1960 and 2017 was performed using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, partial nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nrLSU), partial second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2), and minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (mcm7). 49 Lactarius species were identified in three Lactarius subgenera: L. subg. Russularia (17 spp.), L. subg. Lactarius (22 spp.), and L. subg. Plinthogalus (10 spp.). Among them, 28 Lactarius species were identified as new to science, while just 17 were previously described Lactarius species. Four of the taxa remain un-named due to paucity of materials. A key to Korean Lactarius species, molecular phylogenies, a summary of diversity, and detailed description are provided.},

Non-AMF DNA of 14 plants, 14 Basidiomycota and 18 Ascomycota was also tested as negative controls.

The effect of variable tissue nitrogen content on decomposition rates was evaluated by comparing mass loss among site-specific dominant species from each wetland. Effects of variable surface water and sediment nutrient concentrations on decomposition were assessed by measuring mass loss of standard litter materials (Typha latifolia and cellulose) of uniform C:N ratio. Decomposition of the site-specific dominant litter was significantly correlated with tissue C:N ratios and phosphorus concentrations in wetland waters and sediments. Water column and sediment phosphorus were also significant predictors of decomposition rates for the standard litter types. Nitrogen concentrations in surface waters were not significant predictors of decomposition for any of the substrates in either season.

  abstract = {Ecologists and evolutionary biologists rely on an increasingly sophisticated set of statistical tools to describe complex natural systems. One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

  abstract = {Seven indigenous truffle species with recognized culinary value are harvested in North America. The four ``Oregon'' truffles found along the west coast include Tuber oregonense Trappe, Bonito \& Rawlinson, T. gibbosum Harkn., Leucangium carthusianum (Tul. \& C. Tul.) Paol., and Kalapuya brunnea Trappe, Trappe \& Bonito. Their reputation suffered initially from indiscriminate harvest of immature truffles, but education of chefs and promotion of truffle dogs have contributed to improved quality and an upward price trend. The principal habitat of Oregon truffles is young afforested Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco plantations, which may make them excellent candidates for cultivation. Three additional indigenous species are located in the eastern third of the continent: T. lyonii Butters, T. canaliculatum Gilkey, and Imaia gigantea (Imai) Trappe \& Kov{\'a}cs. Of them, T. lyonii has received significant attention. It occurs from central Mexico to southeast Canada with a broad host range. Tuber lyonii may be an excellent candidate for cultivation as well given its abundance beneath managed Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch. (pecan) orchards. Orchards of trees inoculated with European truffles are widely established over the continent, and production of T. melanosporum Vittad. (and one case of T. borchii Vittad.) is documented from a number of orchards. Most sites require heavy application of agricultural lime to raise soil pH for cultivation of European truffles, with poorly understood effects on soil biota and nutrient cycling, increasing uncertainty of results. T. melanosporum fruiting in North America has occurred in regions with longer and warmer summers than the regions where it evolved, creating potential for significant expansion of the geographic areas considered climatically suitable for its cultivation.},

  abstract = {We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and ANOVA. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and amonggroup components by MANOVA, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

Both poisoning incidents occurred in adults and were associated with severe gastrointestinal symptoms including profuse diarrhea, vomiting and intestinal pain. In each case, hospitalization was required. An unusual aspect of one case was the development of signs and symptoms suggestive of muscarine poisoning. The review includes a description of the mushroom, the geographic distribution of cases, the signs and symptoms of poisoning and its treatment, the toxic principles, particularly susceptible populations, and the variations in response associated with cooking C. molybdites and with individual idiosyncrasies. For identification of C. molybdites, the reader is alerted to the inappropriateness of some books, including many written in Europe, and is warned of the occasional finding of sterile mushrooms that lack its characteristic green basidiospores. Spores, as allergens, are discussed and simple rules are given for eaters of wild mushrooms.},

  abstract = {Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant beingRana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, andBufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish andAmbystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.},

However, as there are few quantitative methods for evaluating their joint effects, resolving this interaction is difficult. We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods of characterizing biodiversity are increasingly being supplemented and replaced by approaches based on DNA sequencing alone. These approaches commonly involve extraction and high-throughput sequencing of bulk samples from biologically complex communities or samples of environmental DNA (eDNA). In such cases, vouchers for individual organisms are rarely obtained, often unidentifiable, or unavailable. Thus, identifying these sequences typically relies on comparisons with sequences from genetic databases, particularly GenBank. While concerns have been raised about biases and inaccuracies in laboratory and analytical methods, comparatively little attention has been paid to the taxonomic reliability of GenBank itself. Here we analyze the metazoan mitochondrial sequences of GenBank using a combination of distance-based clustering and phylogenetic analysis. Because of their comparatively rapid evolutionary rates and consequent high taxonomic resolution, mitochondrial sequences represent an invaluable resource for the detection of the many small and often undescribed organisms that represent the bulk of animal diversity. We show that metazoan identifications in GenBank are surprisingly accurate, even at low taxonomic levels (likely {$<$}1\% error rate at the genus level). This stands in contrast to previously voiced concerns based on limited analyses of particular groups and the fact that individual researchers currently submit annotated sequences to GenBank without significant external taxonomic validation. Our encouraging results suggest that the rapid uptake of DNA-based approaches is supported by a bioinformatic infrastructure capable of assessing both the losses to biodiversity caused by global change and the effectiveness of conservation efforts aimed at slowing or reversing these losses.},

  abstract = {Analysis of environmental DNA is increasingly used to characterize ecological communities, but the effectiveness of this approach depends on the accuracy of taxonomic reference databases. The MIDORI databases, first released in 2017, were built to improve accuracy for mitochondrial metazoan (animal) sequences. MIDORI has now been significantly improved and renamed MIDORI2 (available at http://www.reference-midori.info). Like MIDORI, MIDORI2 is built from GenBank and contains curated sequences of thirteen protein-coding and two ribosomal RNA mitochondrial genes. Coverage has been substantially expanded to cover all eukaryotes, including fungi, green algae and land plants, other multicellular algal groups, and diverse protist lineages. MIDORI2 also now includes not only species with full binomials, but also taxa referred to by genus with species left unspecified (``sp.''). Another new feature is the updating of the databases approximately every two months with version numbers corresponding to each new GenBank release. Additional potentially erroneously annotated sequences have also been removed. Finally, the ability to export data files to BLAST+ has been added to the original ability to export preformatted data to five taxonomic assignment programs, and databases of amino acid sequences are also made available for protein-coding genes. As a technical validation, we conducted a preliminary comparison of the performance of MIDORI2 with five taxonomic assignment programs. Results suggest that BLAST+ top hits performed better for assigning CO1 sequences than alignment-free methods based on compositional features. Comparing MIDORI2 with two other commonly used curated databases of mitochondrial sequences, CO-ARBitrator and BOLD, we show that MIDORI2 includes sequences from a broader range of metazoan and non-metazoan taxa. Overall, in many contexts, MIDORI2 offers clear advantages: a higher diversity of taxa than other databases, a variety of user-friendly features, and regular updates. MIDORI2 is particularly well-suited for environmental DNA studies that target mitochondrial genes with broad primers.},

  abstract = {The genus Pycnoporus forms a group of four species known especially for producing high redox potential laccases suitable for white biotechnology. A sample of 36 Pycnoporus strains originating from different geographical areas was studied to seek informative molecular markers for the typing of new strains in laboratory culture conditions and to analyse the phylogeographic relationships in this cosmopolitan group. ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA and partial regions of {$\beta$}-tubulin and laccase lac3-1 gene were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees inferred from these sequences clearly differentiated the group of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus strains from the group of Pycnoporus puniceus strains into strongly supported clades (100\% bootstrap value). Molecular clustering based on lac 3-1 sequences enabled the distribution of Pycnoporus sanguineus and Pycnoporus coccineus through four distinct, well supported clades and sub-clades. A neotropical sub-clade, grouping the P. sanguineus strains from French Guiana and Venezuela, corresponded to P. sanguineus sensu stricto. A paleotropical sub-clade, clustering the strains from Madagascar, Vietnam and New Caledonia, was defined as Pycnoporus cf. sanguineus. The Australian clade corresponded to P. coccineus sensu stricto. The Eastern Asian region clade, clustering the strains from China and Japan, formed a P. coccineus-like group. Laccase gene (lac 3-1) analysis within the Pycnoporus species can highlight enzyme functional diversity associated with biogeographical origin.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare---the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract = {The most common evolutionary events at the molecular level are single-base substitutions, as well as insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments. A large body of research has been devoted to develop probabilistic substitution models and to infer their parameters using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In contrast, relatively little has been done to model indel dynamics, probably due to the difficulty in writing explicit likelihood functions. Here, we contribute to the effort of modeling indel dynamics by presenting SpartaABC, an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to infer indel parameters from sequence data (either aligned or unaligned). SpartaABC circumvents the need to use an explicit likelihood function by extracting summary statistics from simulated sequences. First, summary statistics are extracted from the input sequence data. Second, SpartaABC samples indel parameters from a prior distribution and uses them to simulate sequences. Third, it computes summary statistics from the simulated sets of sequences. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC can provide an approximation to the posterior distribution of indel parameters as well as point estimates. We study the performance of our methodology and show that it provides accurate estimates of indel parameters in simulations. We next demonstrate the utility of SpartaABC by studying the impact of alignment errors on the inference of positive selection. A C\,++\,program implementing SpartaABC is freely available in http://spartaabc.tau.ac.il.},

  abstract = {Classic alignment algorithms utilize scoring functions which maximize similarity or minimize edit distances. These scoring functions account for both insertion--deletion (indel) and substitution events. In contrast, alignments based on stochastic models aim to explicitly describe the evolutionary dynamics of sequences by inferring relevant probabilistic parameters from input sequences. Despite advances in stochastic modeling during the last two decades, scoring-based methods are still dominant, partially due to slow running times of probabilistic approaches. Alignment inference using stochastic models involves estimating the probability of events, such as the insertion or deletion of a specific number of characters. In this work, we present SimBa-SAl, a simulation-based approach to statistical alignment inference, which relies on an explicit continuous time Markov model for both indels and substitutions. SimBa-SAl has several advantages. First, using simulations, it decouples the estimation of event probabilities from the inference stage, which allows the introduction of accelerations to the alignment inference procedure. Second, it is general and can accommodate various stochastic models of indel formation. Finally, it allows computing the maximum-likelihood alignment, the probability of a given pair of sequences integrated over all possible alignments, and sampling alternative alignments according to their probability. We first show that SimBa-SAl allows accurate estimation of parameters of the long-indel model previously developed by Mikl{\'o}s et al. (2004). We next show that SimBa-SAl is more accurate than previously developed pairwise alignment algorithms, when analyzing simulated as well as empirical data sets. Finally, we study the goodness-of-fit of the long-indel and TKF91 models. We show that although the long-indel model fits the data sets better than TKF91, there is still room for improvement concerning the realistic modeling of evolutionary sequence dynamics.},

A deeper understanding of this relationship is necessary, in order to provide recommendations on how to improve the quality of data collection on macrofungal diversity in different land use systems in future studies, a systematic assessment of methodological parameters, in particular optimal plot sizes. The species-area relationship of macrofungi in tropical and temperate climatic zones and four different land use systems were investigated by determining the macrofungal species richness in plot sizes ranging from 100~m2 to 10~000~m2 over two sampling seasons. We found that the effect of plot size on recorded species richness significantly differed between land use systems with the exception of monoculture systems. For both climate zones, land use system needs to be considered when determining optimal plot size. Using an optimal plot size was more important than temporal replication (over two sampling seasons) in accurately recording species richness.},

  abstract = {Wild mushrooms are a vital source of income and nutrition for many poor communities and of value to recreational foragers. Literature relating to the edibility of mushroom species continues to expand, driven by an increasing demand for wild mushrooms, a wider interest in foraging, and the study of traditional foods. Although numerous case reports have been published on edible mushrooms, doubt and confusion persist regarding which species are safe and suitable to consume. Case reports often differ, and the evidence supporting the stated properties of mushrooms can be incomplete or ambiguous. The need for greater clarity on edible species is further underlined by increases in mushroom-related poisonings. We propose a system for categorizing mushroom species and assigning a final edibility status. Using this system, we reviewed 2,786 mushroom species from 99 countries, accessing 9,783 case reports, from over 1,100 sources. We identified 2,189 edible species, of which 2,006 can be consumed safely, and a further 183 species which required some form of pretreatment prior to safe consumption or were associated with allergic reactions by some. We identified 471 species of uncertain edibility because of missing or incomplete evidence of consumption, and 76 unconfirmed species because of unresolved, differing opinions on edibility and toxicity. This is the most comprehensive list of edible mushrooms available to date, demonstrating the huge number of mushrooms species consumed. Our review highlights the need for further information on uncertain and clash species, and the need to present evidence in a clear, unambiguous, and consistent manner.},

  abstract = {DNA-based identification is vital for classifying biological specimens, yet methods to quantify the uncertainty of sequence-based taxonomic assignments are scarce. Challenges arise from noisy reference databases, including mislabelled entries and missing taxa. PROTAX addresses these issues with a probabilistic approach to taxonomic classification, advancing on methods that rely solely on sequence similarity. It provides calibrated probabilistic assignments to a partially populated taxonomic hierarchy, accounting for taxa that lack references and incorrect taxonomic annotation. While effective on smaller scales, global application of PROTAX necessitates substantially larger reference libraries, a goal previously hindered by computational barriers. We introduce PROTAX-GPU, a scalable algorithm capable of leveraging the global Barcode of Life Data System ({$>$}14 million specimens) as a reference database. Using graphics processing units (GPU) to accelerate similarity and nearest-neighbour operations and the JAX library for Python integration, we achieve over a 1000 {\texttimes} speedup compared with the central processing unit (CPU)-based implementation without compromising PROTAX's key benefits. PROTAX-GPU marks a significant stride towards real-time DNA barcoding, enabling quicker and more efficient species identification in environmental assessments. This capability opens up new avenues for real-time monitoring and analysis of biodiversity, advancing our ability to understand and respond to ecological dynamics.

  abstract = {I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence--absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

  abstract = {So far approximately 144,000 species of fungi have been named but sequences of the majority of them do not exist in the public databases. Therefore, the quality and coverage of public barcode databases is a bottleneck that hinders the study of fungi. Cortinarius is the largest genus of Agaricales with thousands of species world-wide. The most diverse subgenus in Cortinarius is Telamonia and its species have been considered one of the most taxonomically challenging in the Agaricales. Its high diversity combined with convergent, similar appearing taxa have earned it a reputation of being an impossible group to study. In this study a total of 746 specimens, including 482 type specimens representing 184 species were sequenced. Also, a significant number of old types were successfully sequenced, 105 type specimens were over 50 years old and 18 type specimens over 100 years old. Altogether, 20 epi- or neotypes are proposed for recently commonly used older names. Our study doubles the number of reliable DNA-barcodes of species of C. subgenus Telamonia in the public sequence databases. This is also the first extensive phylogenetic study of the subgenus. A majority of the sections and species are shown in a phylogenetic context for the first time. Our study shows that nomenclatural problems, even in difficult groups like C. subgenus Telamonia, can be solved and consequently identification of species based on ITS barcodes becomes an easy task even for non-experts of the genus.},

  abstract = {Family Cortinariaceae currently includes only one genus, Cortinarius, which is the largest Agaricales genus, with thousands of species worldwide. The species are important ectomycorrhizal fungi and form associations with many vascular plant genera from tropicals to arctic regions. Genus Cortinarius contains a lot of morphological variation, and its complexity has led many taxonomists to specialize in particular on infrageneric groups. The previous attempts to divide Cortinarius have been shown to be unnatural and the phylogenetic studies done to date have not been able to resolve the higher-level classification of the group above section level. Genomic approaches have revolutionized our view on fungal relationships and provide a way to tackle difficult groups. We used both targeted capture sequencing and shallow whole genome sequencing to produce data and to perform phylogenomic analyses of 75 single-copy genes from 19 species. In addition, a wider 5-locus analysis of 245 species, from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, was also done. Based on our results, a classification of the family Cortinariaceae into ten genera---Cortinarius, Phlegmacium, Thaxterogaster, Calonarius, Aureonarius, Cystinarius, Volvanarius, Hygronarius, Mystinarius, and Austrocortinarius---is proposed. Seven genera, 10 subgenera, and four sections are described as new to science and five subgenera are introduced as new combinations in a new rank. In addition, 41 section names and 514 species names are combined in new genera and four lecto- and epitypes designated. The position of Stephanopus in suborder Agaricineae remains to be studied. Targeted capture sequencing is used for the first time in fungal taxonomy in Basidiomycetes. It provides a cost-efficient way to produce -omics data in species-rich groups. The -omics data was produced from fungarium specimens up to 21~years old, demonstrating the value of museum specimens in the study of the fungal tree of life. This study is the first family revision in Agaricales based on genomics data and hopefully many others will soon follow.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen availability may be a major factor structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been implicated in the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) sporocarp diversity. We previously characterized the pattern of decreased sporocarp species richness over an anthropogenic N deposition gradient in Alaska (USA). To determine whether this change in sporocarp community structure was paralleled below ground, we used molecular and morphological techniques to characterize the ectomycorrhizal community of white spruce (Picea glauca) over this gradient. We then related patterns of richness and relative abundance of taxa to various N-affected environmental parameters. Species richness of EMF declined dramatically with increasing N inputs. Over 30 taxa were identified at the low-N sites, compared with nine at the high-N sites. Low-N site dominants (Piloderma spp., Amphinema byssoides, Cortinarius spp., and various dark-mantled Tomentella spp.) disappeared completely at the high-N sites, where they were replaced by Lactarius theiogalus, Paxillus involutus, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris, and an unidentified species. Lactarius theiogalus accounted for 44--68\% of the root tips at the high-N sites, compared with 7--20\% of tips at the low-N sites. Organic horizon mineral N and foliar nutrient ratios (N:P, P:Al) were excellent predictors of taxonomic richness (r2 {$>$} 0.93). Organic horizon NO3- availability was the best predictor of abundance of many taxa. These patterns suggest that long-term N deposition can lead to decline in EMF species richness, and dramatic changes in EMF community structure. The consequences of these changes for plant nutrition and ecosystem function depend on how EMF community function changes as community structure changes. We speculate that as N inputs increase, the EMF community shifts from taxa specialized for N uptake under low-N conditions (e.g., Cortinarius, Piloderma), toward taxa specialized for high overall nutrient availability (e.g., Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris) and finally toward taxa specialized for P uptake under high-N, low-P, acidified conditions (e.g., Paxillus involutus, Lactarius theiogalus).},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities are highly diverse at the stand level. To begin to understand what might lead to such diversity, and to improve sampling designs, we investigated the spatial structure of these communities. We used EMF community data from a number of studies carried out in seven mature and one recently fire-initiated forest stand. We applied various measures of spatial pattern to characterize distributions at EMF community and species levels: Mantel tests, Mantel correlograms, variance/mean and standardized variograms. Mantel tests indicated that in four of eight sites community similarity decreased with distance, whereas Mantel correlograms also found spatial autocorrelation in those four plus two additional sites. In all but one of these sites elevated similarity was evident only at relatively small spatial scales ({$<$} 2.6 m), whereas one exhibited a larger scale pattern ({$\sim$}25 m). Evenness of biomass distribution among cores varied widely among taxa. Standardized variograms indicated that most of the dominant taxa showed patchiness at a scale of less than 3 m, with a range from 0 to 17 m. These results have implications for both sampling scale and intensity to achieve maximum efficiency of community sampling. In the systems we examined, cores should be at least 3 m apart to achieve the greatest sampling efficiency for stand-level community analysis. In some cases even this spacing may result in reduced sampling efficiency arising from patterns of spatial autocorrelation. Interpretation of the causes and significance of these patterns requires information on the genetic identity of individuals in the communities.},

  abstract = {Regions of rDNA are commonly used to infer phylogenetic relationships among fungal species and as DNA barcodes for identification. These regions occur in large tandem arrays, and concerted evolution is believed to reduce intragenomic variation among copies within these arrays, although some variation still might exist. Phylogenetic studies typically use consensus sequencing, which effectively conceals most intragenomic variation, but cloned sequences containing intragenomic variation are becoming prevalent in DNA databases. To understand effects of using cloned rDNA sequences in phylogenetic analyses we amplified and cloned the ITS region from pure cultures of six Laetiporus species and one Wolfiporia species (Basidiomycota, Polyporales). An average of 66 clones were selected randomly and sequenced from 21 cultures, producing a total of 1399 interpretable sequences. Significant variation ({$\geq$} 5\% variation in sequence similarity) was observed among ITS copies within six cultures from three species clades (L. cincinnatus, L. sp. clade J, and Wolfiporia dilatohypha) and phylogenetic analyses with the cloned sequences produced different trees relative to analyses with consensus sequences. Cloned sequences from L. cincinnatus fell into more than one species clade and numerous cloned L. cincinnatus sequences fell into entirely new clades, which if analyzed on their own most likely would be recognized as ``undescribed'' or ``novel'' taxa. The use of a 95\% cut off for defining operational taxonomic units (OTUs) produced seven Laetiporus OTUs with consensus ITS sequences and 20 OTUs with cloned ITS sequences. The use of cloned rDNA sequences might be problematic in fungal phylogenetic analyses, as well as in fungal bar-coding initiatives and efforts to detect fungal pathogens in environmental samples.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML.},

The lack of an accurate and robust classification tool trained by a validated sequence database for taxonomic placement of fungal LSU genes is a severe limitation in taxonomic analysis of fungal isolates or large data sets obtained from environmental surveys. Using a hand-curated set of 8,506 fungal LSU gene fragments, we determined the performance characteristics of a na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier across multiple taxonomic levels and compared the classifier performance to that of a sequence similarity-based (BLASTN) approach. The na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier was computationally more rapid ({$>$}460-fold with our system) than the BLASTN approach, and it provided equal or superior classification accuracy. Classifier accuracies were compared using sequence fragments of 100 bp and 400 bp and two different PCR primer anchor points to mimic sequence read lengths commonly obtained using current high-throughput sequencing technologies. Accuracy was higher with 400-bp sequence reads than with 100-bp reads. It was also significantly affected by sequence location across the 1,400-bp test region. The highest accuracy was obtained across either the D1 or D2 variable region. The na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier provides an effective and rapid means to classify fungal LSU sequences from large environmental surveys. The training set and tool are publicly available through the Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/classifier/classifier.jsp).},

  abstract = {Highly accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees for large data sets is difficult, in part because multiple sequence alignments must be accurate for phylogeny estimation methods to be accurate. Coestimation of alignments and trees has been attempted but currently only SAT{\'e} estimates reasonably accurate trees and alignments for large data sets in practical time frames (Liu K., Raghavan S., Nelesen S., Linder C.R., Warnow T. 2009b. Rapid and accurate large-scale coestimation of sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. Science. 324:1561-1564). Here, we present a modification to the original SAT{\'e} algorithm that improves upon SAT{\'e} (which we now call SAT{\'e}-I) in terms of speed and of phylogenetic and alignment accuracy. SAT{\'e}-II uses a different divide-and-conquer strategy than SAT{\'e}-I and so produces smaller more closely related subsets than SAT{\'e}-I; as a result, SAT{\'e}-II produces more accurate alignments and trees, can analyze larger data sets, and runs more efficiently than SAT{\'e}-I. Generally, SAT{\'e} is a metamethod that takes an existing multiple sequence alignment method as an input parameter and boosts the quality of that alignment method. SAT{\'e}-II-boosted alignment methods are significantly more accurate than their unboosted versions, and trees based upon these improved alignments are more accurate than trees based upon the original alignments. Because SAT{\'e}-I used maximum likelihood (ML) methods that treat gaps as missing data to estimate trees and because we found a correlation between the quality of tree/alignment pairs and ML scores, we explored the degree to which SAT{\'e}'s performance depends on using ML with gaps treated as missing data to determine the best tree/alignment pair. We present two lines of evidence that using ML with gaps treated as missing data to optimize the alignment and tree produces very poor results. First, we show that the optimization problem where a set of unaligned DNA sequences is given and the output is the tree and alignment of those sequences that maximize likelihood under the Jukes-Cantor model is uninformative in the worst possible sense. For all inputs, all trees optimize the likelihood score. Second, we show that a greedy heuristic that uses GTR+Gamma ML to optimize the alignment and the tree can produce very poor alignments and trees. Therefore, the excellent performance of SAT{\'e}-II and SAT{\'e}-I is not because ML is used as an optimization criterion for choosing the best tree/alignment pair but rather due to the particular divide-and-conquer realignment techniques employed.},

  abstract = {Background The Smith-Waterman-Gotoh alignment algorithm is the most popular method for comparing biological sequences. Recently, Single Instruction Multiple Data methods have been used to speed up alignment. However, these algorithms have limitations like being optimized for specific scoring schemes, cannot handle large gaps, or require quadratic time computation. Results We propose a new algorithm called block aligner for aligning nucleotide and protein sequences. It greedily shifts and grows a block of computed scores to span large gaps within the aligned sequences. This greedy approach is able to only compute a fraction of the DP matrix. In exchange for these features, there is no guarantee that the computed scores are accurate compared to full DP. However, in our experiments, we show that block aligner performs accurately on various realistic datasets, and it is up to 9 times faster than the popular Farrar's algorithm for protein global alignments. Conclusions Our algorithm has applications in computing global alignments and X-drop alignments on proteins and long reads. It is available as a Rust library at https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner.},

Our analyses suggest that both our inference scheme and the model-selection procedure achieve high accuracy on simulated data. We further demonstrate that our proposed richer model better fits a large number of empirical data sets and that, for the majority of these data sets, the deletion rate is higher than the insertion rate.},

  abstract = {Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number variation (CNV) has major physiological implications for all organisms, but how it varies for fungi, an ecologically ubiquitous and important group of microorganisms, has yet to be systemically investigated. Here, we examine rDNA CNV using an in silico read depth approach for 91 fungal taxa with sequenced genomes and assess copy number conservation across phylogenetic scales and ecological lifestyles. rDNA copy number varied considerably across fungi, ranging from an estimated 14 to 1,442 copies (mean = 113, median = 82), and copy number similarity was inversely correlated with phylogenetic distance. No correlations were found between rDNA CNV and fungal trophic mode, ecological guild or genome size. Taken together, these results show that like other microorganisms, fungi exhibit substantial variation in rDNA copy number, which is linked to their phylogeny in a scale-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {In dryland ecosystems, the timing and magnitude of precipitation pulses drive many key ecological processes, notably soil water availability for plants and soil microbiota. Plant available water has frequently been viewed simply as incoming precipitation, yet processes at larger scales drive precipitation pulses, and the subsequent transformation of precipitation pulses to plant available water are complex. We provide an overview of the factors that influence the spatial and temporal availability of water to plants and soil biota using examples from western USA drylands. Large spatial- and temporal-scale drivers of regional precipitation patterns include the position of the jet streams and frontal boundaries, the North American Monsoon, El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation events, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Topography and orography modify the patterns set up by the larger-scale drivers, resulting in regional patterns (102--106 km2) of precipitation magnitude, timing, and variation. Together, the large-scale and regional drivers impose important pulsed patterns on long-term precipitation trends at landscape scales, in which most site precipitation is received as small events ({$<$}5 mm) and with most of the intervals between events being short ({$<$}10 days). The drivers also influence the translation of precipitation events into available water via linkages between soil water content and components of the water budget, including interception, infiltration and runoff, soil evaporation, plant water use and hydraulic redistribution, and seepage below the rooting zone. Soil water content varies not only vertically with depth but also horizontally beneath versus between plants and/or soil crusts in ways that are ecologically important to different plant and crust types. We highlight the importance of considering larger-scale drivers, and their effects on regional patterns; small, frequent precipitation events; and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in soil water content in translating from climatology to precipitation pulses to the dryland ecohydrology of water availability for plants and soil biota.},

  abstract = {Culture-based molecular identification methods have revolutionized detection of pathogens, yet these methods are slow and may yield inconclusive results from environmental materials. The second-generation sequencing tools have much-improved precision and sensitivity of detection, but these analyses are costly and may take several days to months. Of the third-generation sequencing techniques, the portable MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) has received much attention because of its small size and possibility of rapid analysis at reasonable cost. Here, we compare the relative performances of two third-generation sequencing instruments, MinION and Sequel (Pacific Biosciences), in identification and diagnostics of fungal and oomycete pathogens from conifer (Pinaceae) needles and potato (Solanum tuberosum) leaves and tubers. We demonstrate that the Sequel instrument is efficient for metabarcoding of complex samples, whereas MinION is not suited for this purpose due to a high error rate and multiple biases. However, we find that MinION can be utilized for rapid and accurate identification of dominant pathogenic organisms and other associated organisms from plant tissues following both amplicon-based and PCR-free metagenomics approaches. Using the metagenomics approach with shortened DNA extraction and incubation times, we performed the entire MinION workflow, from sample preparation through DNA extraction, sequencing, bioinformatics, and interpretation, in 2.5 h. We advocate the use of MinION for rapid diagnostics of pathogens and potentially other organisms, but care needs to be taken to control or account for multiple potential technical biases. IMPORTANCE Microbial pathogens cause enormous losses to agriculture and forestry, but current combined culturing- and molecular identification-based detection methods are too slow for rapid identification and application of countermeasures. Here, we develop new and rapid protocols for Oxford Nanopore MinION-based third-generation diagnostics of plant pathogens that greatly improve the speed of diagnostics. However, due to high error rate and technical biases in MinION, the Pacific BioSciences Sequel platform is more useful for in-depth amplicon-based biodiversity monitoring (metabarcoding) from complex environmental samples.},

Populations of this species are highly threatened in large parts of its range due to overexploitation and environmental degradation. In the light of climatic changes, safeguarding the genetic diversity of the species is crucial to foster adaptation and to support its long-term survival. Genetic insight is also relevant to guide sustainable harvesting. This paper has the objective to review information on the species' geographic distribution, reproductive biology, genetic characteristics and existing conservation practices, and to identify knowledge gaps to orientate future conservation and research focus. The literature review revealed that the species is mainly outcrossed and is pollinated by a diversity of vectors, including bats that allow long-pollen dispersal. When bats are absent, pollination is mainly carried out by honey bees and stingless bees and in such case pollen-mediated gene flow is relatively restricted. Data of a large-scale genetic study based on allozyme markers showing a moderate genetic differentiation among populations were reanalyzed using an inverse distance weighted interpolation function. Three distinctive regions of diversity based on allelic richness and expected heterozygosity were identified. Finally, we discuss future challenges for genetic conservation by emphasizing the need to use both neutral and adaptive markers in future research. {$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The genomes of ECM Russulaceae are characterized by a loss of genes for plant cell-wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), an expansion of genome size through increased transposable element (TE) content, a reduction in secondary metabolism clusters, and an association of small secreted proteins (SSPs) with TE ``nests'', or dense aggregations of TEs. Some PCWDEs have been retained or even expanded, mostly in a species-specific manner. The genome of Gloeopeniophorella convolvens possesses some characteristics of ECM genomes (e.g., loss of some PCWDEs, TE expansion, reduction in secondary metabolism clusters). Functional specialization in ectomycorrhizal decomposition may drive diversification. Accelerated gene evolution predates the evolution of the ECM habit, indicating that changes in genome architecture and gene content may be necessary to prime the evolutionary switch.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, symbiotic mutualists of many dominant tree and shrub species, exhibit a biogeographic pattern counter to the established latitudinal diversity gradient of most macroflora and fauna. However, an evolutionary basis for this pattern has not been explicitly tested in a diverse lineage. In this study, we reconstructed a mega-phylogeny of a cosmopolitan and hyperdiverse genus of ECM fungi, Russula, sampling from annotated collections and utilizing publically available sequences deposited in GenBank. Metadata from molecular operational taxonomic unit cluster sets were examined to infer the distribution and plant association of the genus. This allowed us to test for differences in patterns of diversification between tropical and extratropical taxa, as well as how their associations with different plant lineages may be a driver of diversification. Results show that Russula is most species-rich at temperate latitudes and ancestral state reconstruction shows that the genus initially diversified in temperate areas. Migration into and out of the tropics characterizes the early evolution of the genus, and these transitions have been frequent since this time. We propose the `generalized diversification rate' hypothesis to explain the reversed latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in Russula as we detect a higher net diversification rate in extratropical lineages. Patterns of diversification with plant associates support host switching and host expansion as driving diversification, with a higher diversification rate in lineages associated with Pinaceae and frequent transitions to association with angiosperms.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is an essential guild of many forested ecosystems and has a dynamic evolutionary history across kingdom Fungi, having independently evolved from diverse types of saprotrophic ancestors. In this study, we seek to identify genomic features of the transition to the ectomycorrhizal habit within the Russulaceae, one of the most diverse lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We present comparative analyses of the pangenome and gene repertoires of 21 species across the order Russulales, including a closely related saprotrophic member of Russulaceae. The ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae is inferred to have originated around the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (73.6-60.1 million years ago (MY)). The genomes of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae are characterized by a loss of genes for plant cell-wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), an expansion of genome size through increased transposable element (TE) content, a reduction in secondary metabolism clusters, and an association of genes coding for certain secreted proteins with TE "nests". The saprotrophic sister group of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae, Gloeopeniophorella convolvens, possesses some of these aspects (e.g., loss of PCWDE and protease orthologs, TE expansion, reduction in secondary metabolism clusters), resulting from an accelerated rate of gene evolution in the shared ancestor of Russulaceae that predates the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal habit. Genomes of Russulaceae possess a high degree of synteny, including a conserved set of terpene secondary metabolite gene clusters. We hypothesize that the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal habit requires premodification of the genome for plant root association followed by an accelerated rate of gene evolution within the secretome for host-defense circumvention and symbiosis establishment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Biological indicators of ecosystem integrity are increasingly being sought for use in ecosystem assessment and goal-setting for restoration projects. We tested the effectiveness of a plant community-based bioassessment tool, the floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) in 20 depressional wetlands in Ohio, USA. A priori, the 20 depressional wetlands were classified by type and ranked to form a disturbance gradient according to the local landscape condition. Ranks were based on surrounding land cover characteristics, vegetated buffer characteristics, and the extent of human-induced hydrologic alteration at the wetland site. The index was negatively correlated with the disturbance rank of a wetland and with the distance to neighboring wetlands (P = 0.01). Index values were lower for wetlands surrounded by agricultural or urban land use, wetlands with less vegetation on the wetland perimeter, and wetlands with more hydrologic modification, and at sites with greater distances to other wetlands. The wetlands with lower FQAI values tended to be dominated by plants that are typical of heavily cultivated landscapes or urban regions. Thus, the index is interpreted as a measure of environmental factors that maintain and control plant communities. The index was not correlated with differences in wetland surface water chemistry ({$\alpha$} = 0.05) but was positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (P = 0.01), phosphorus (P = 0.05), and calcium (P = 0.05). Repeated wetland sampling in the summer and autumn revealed that the floristic quality assessment index could be useful for the assessment and monitoring of wetland ecosystems and for tracking wetland restoration projects over time.},

  abstract = {Summary Estimates of the number of arthropod species vary between 1,170,000 and 10 million, accounting for over 80\% of all known living animal species. One arthropod subgroup, insects, is the most species-rich member of all ecological guilds in land and freshwater environments (1). As arthropods were emerging as the dominant animals they are today, fungi were also colonizing the land. Over the past 400 million years fungi and insects have coevolved a wide array of intimate interactions (2 , 3). These interactions include mutualistic endosymbiosis (4); fungi as obligate food sources, such as those found in fungus-gardening ants (5); sexually and behaviorally transmitted parasites, such as Laboulbeniales (6); and the most common disease-causing agents of insects (7). Entomopathogenicity has evolved independently and repeatedly in all the major phyla of the Kingdom Fungi (3). The heterogeneity of entomopathogenic fungi probably derives from both they and their hosts having short generation times, i.e., rapidly driving new diversity with each generation, and from their occupation of a wide range of habitats, with near ubiquity in the soil and on plants. Interactions among fungi, hosts, and the environment are therefore diverse and dynamic, which complicates comparisons between different fungi infecting different insects since their interactions may be necessarily disparate. Historically, this quandary was dealt with by intensively studying the host pathogen interactions of a couple of experimentally tractable fungal species, and then extrapolating these results to distantly related species. Consequently, most of what we know about the biochemical and molecular basis of interactions between fungi and insects has been determined with the experimentally tractable hypocrealean ascomycete genera Metarhizium (family Clavicipitaceae) and Beauveria (family Cordycipitaceae). Metarhizium, in particular, has also emerged as an excellent model to explore a broad array of questions in ecology and evolution, host preference and host switching, and the mechanisms of speciation.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of large numbers of sequences is demanding and the computational burden is further increased by downstream analyses depending on these alignments. With the abundance of sequence data, an integrative approach of adding new sequences to existing alignments without their full re-computation and maintaining the relative matching of existing sequences is an attractive option. Another current challenge is the extension of reference alignments with fragmented sequences, as those coming from next-generation metagenomics, that contain relatively little information. Widely used methods for alignment extension are based on profile representation of reference sequences. These do not incorporate and use phylogenetic information and are affected by the composition of the reference alignment and the phylogenetic positions of query sequences.Results: We have developed a method for phylogeny-aware alignment of partial-order sequence graphs and apply it here to the extension of alignments with new data. Our new method, called PAGAN, infers ancestral sequences for the reference alignment and adds new sequences in their phylogenetic context, either to predefined positions or by finding the best placement for sequences of unknown origin. Unlike profile-based alternatives, PAGAN considers the phylogenetic relatedness of the sequences and is not affected by inclusion of more diverged sequences in the reference set. Our analyses show that PAGAN outperforms alternative methods for alignment extension and provides superior accuracy for both DNA and protein data, the improvement being especially large for fragmented sequences. Moreover, PAGAN-generated alignments of noisy next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequences are accurate enough for the use of RNA-seq data in evolutionary analyses.Availability: PAGAN is written in C++, licensed under the GPL and its source code is available at http://code.google.com/p/pagan-msa.Contact:ari.loytynoja@helsinki.fiSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

  abstract = {The assessment of microbial diversity and distribution is a major concern in environmental microbiology. There are two general approaches for measuring community diversity: quantitative measures, which use the abundance of each taxon, and qualitative measures, which use only the presence/absence of data. Quantitative measures are ideally suited to revealing community differences that are due to changes in relative taxon abundance (e.g., when a particular set of taxa flourish because a limiting nutrient source becomes abundant). Qualitative measures are most informative when communities differ primarily by what can live in them (e.g., at high temperatures), in part because abundance information can obscure significant patterns of variation in which taxa are present. We illustrate these principles using two 16S rRNA-based surveys of microbial populations and two phylogenetic measures of community beta diversity: unweighted UniFrac, a qualitative measure, and weighted UniFrac, a new quantitative measure, which we have added to the UniFrac website (http://bmf.colorado.edu/unifrac). These studies considered the relative influences of mineral chemistry, temperature, and geography on microbial community composition in acidic thermal springs in Yellowstone National Park and the influences of obesity and kinship on microbial community composition in the mouse gut. We show that applying qualitative and quantitative measures to the same data set can lead to dramatically different conclusions about the main factors that structure microbial diversity and can provide insight into the nature of community differences. We also demonstrate that both weighted and unweighted UniFrac measurements are robust to the methods used to build the underlying phylogeny.},

  abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that higher temporal variability in water supply will promote higher species richness of germinating and surviving seedlings using assemblages of 70 species of herbaceous plants from limestone pavement habitats. In a two-factor greenhouse experiment, doubling the total volume of water added led to greater germination (measured as number of germinated seeds and species) and establishment (survival and biomass) but the effects of temporal variability depended on the response variable considered. Low pulse frequencies of water addition with total volume added held constant resulted in greater temporal variability in soil moisture concentration that in turn promoted higher density and richness of germinated seedlings. Low pulse frequencies caused an eight-fold greater mortality in the low total volume treatment and biomass production to decline by one-third in the high total volume treatment. The effects of increasing temporal variability in water supply during recruitment stages can thus be opposite on different components of plant fitness and may also depend on total resource quantity. While greater species richness in more temporally variable soil moisture conditions was attributable to sampling effects rather than species-specific responses to the water treatments, species relative abundances did vary significantly with temporal variability. Changes in the amplitude or frequency of resource fluctuations may alter recruitment patterns, and could have severe and relatively rapid effects on community structure in unproductive ecosystems.},

We present VeChat, as an approach to implement this idea: VeChat is based on variation graphs, as a popular type of data structure for pangenome reference systems. Extensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that long reads corrected by VeChat contain 4 to 15 (Pacific Biosciences) and 1 to 10 times (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) less errors than when being corrected by state of the art approaches. Further, using VeChat prior to long-read assembly significantly improves the haplotype awareness of the assemblies.

Two plots were placed in woodland, two in wooded grassland, and two in transition woodland in order to describe structure and floristic composition of the vegetation. All trees {$\geq$} 5 cm dbh were sampled. The three selected vegetation types showed distinct differences in structure as well as in species composition. Woodland had high density (440?449 individuals per ha), many small trees, and high basal area (13.4 m2per ha). Transition woodland was characterised by low density (54?118 individuals per ha) but many large trees and a relatively large basal area (8.6?12.8 m2 per ha). Wooded grassland was characterised by medium sized trees, it had low density (86?102 individuals per ha) and low basal area (3.8?5.7 m2 per ha). Species richness ranged between 17 and 27 species per ha in the six plots. Only two species were found in all plots, Daniellia oliveri (Caesalpiniaceae) and Prosopis africana (Mimosaceae). Legumes dominated all plots. Wooded grassland and transition woodland had many characteristics of fire-affected vegetation in contrast to woodland. Today wooded grassland encroaches on woodland and transition woodland. Management of the latter two vegetation types should be given priority as they maintain structural and floristic characteristics that are essential to conserve biodiversity and original features of the vegetation, and they are also important for local people who are allowed to make sustainable use of the vegetation.},

Lactifluus (L. flavellus), subgen. Russulopsis (L. longibasidius and L. pectinatus), and subgen. Edules (L. melleus). This demonstrates that the current species richness of the genus is considerably higher than hitherto estimated for African species and, in addition, a need to redefine the subgenera and sections within it.},

  abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used as a tool to assess biodiversity in research and environmental management. Powerful analysis software exists to process raw data. However, the translation of sequence read data into biological information and downstream analyses may be difficult for end users with limited expertise in bioinformatics. Thus, there is a growing need for easy-to-use, graphical user interface (GUI) software to analyse and visualise DNA metabarcoding data. Here, we present TaxonTableTools (TTT), a new platform-independent GUI that aims to fill this gap by providing simple, reproducible analysis and visualisation workflows. At its base, TTT uses a 'TaXon table', which is a data format that can be generated easily within TTT from two input files: a read table and a taxonomy table obtained using various published metabarcoding pipelines. TTT analysis and visualisation modules include Venn diagrams to compare taxon overlap among replicates, samples, or analysis methods. TTT analyses and visualises basic statistics, such as read proportion per taxon, as well as more sophisticated visualisations, such as interactive Krona charts for taxonomic data exploration. Various ecological analyses can be produced directly, including alpha or beta diversity estimates, and rarefaction analysis ordination plots. Metabarcoding data can be converted into formats required for traditional, taxonomy-based analyses performed by regulatory bioassessment programs. In addition, TTT is able to produce html-based interactive graphics that can be analysed in any web browser. The software comes with a manual and tutorial, is free and publicly available through GitHub (https://github.com/TillMacher/TaxonTableTools) or the Python package index (https://pypi.org/project/taxontabletools/).},

Swarm v2 also directly integrates the clustering and breaking phases, dereplicates sequencing reads with d = 0, outputs OTU representatives in fasta format, and plots individual OTUs as two-dimensional networks.},

The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here, we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. {$>$} 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and it implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny. Our open source software allows easy integration with other Python packages as well as a variety of evolutionary models, including indel models and new hypermutability models that we developed to more realistically represent SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Background Sequence alignment is crucial in genomics studies. However, optimal multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is NP-hard. Thus, modern MSA methods employ progressive heuristics, breaking the problem into a series of pairwise alignments guided by a phylogeny. Changes between homologous characters are typically modelled by a Markov substitution model. In contrast, the dynamics of indels are not modelled explicitly, because the computation of the marginal likelihood under such models has exponential time complexity in the number of taxa. But the failure to model indel evolution may lead to artificially short alignments due to biased indel placement, inconsistent with phylogenetic relationship. Results Recently, the classical indel model TKF91 was modified to describe indel evolution on a phylogeny via a Poisson process, termed PIP. PIP allows to compute the joint marginal probability of an MSA and a tree in linear time. We present a new dynamic programming algorithm to align two MSAs --represented by the underlying homology paths-- by full maximum likelihood under PIP in polynomial time, and apply it progressively along a guide tree. We have corroborated the correctness of our method by simulation, and compared it with competitive methods on an illustrative real dataset. Conclusions Our MSA method is the first polynomial time progressive aligner with a rigorous mathematical formulation of indel evolution. The new method infers phylogenetically meaningful gap patterns alternative to the popular PRANK, while producing alignments of similar length. Moreover, the inferred gap patterns agree with what was predicted qualitatively by previous studies. The algorithm is implemented in a standalone C++ program: https://github.com/acg-team/ProPIP.

  abstract = {In the Miombo ecoregion (2,865,000 km{$^2$} or 9.1\% of Africa), the Zambezian open forest constitutes the main vegetation unit. It extends to no less than eight countries, from Burundi in the North to South Africa in the South, and from Angola in the West to Mozambique in the East. The austral part of Africa\&\#39;s open forests falls within the Zambezian Regional Center of Endemism outlined by White in 1983. This book focuses mainly on the wetter Zambezian Miombo woodlands. Also patches of mosaic Zambezian dry evergreen forests and small areas of grasslands on Kalahari sands are incorporated in the study.The aim of this book is to gather together the amazing local environment knowledge of Zambezian open forests peoples in order to permit an easier improvement of their well-being. This research has been developed in an ethnoecological way of thinking. Indeed, the synergy arising from putting together local knowledge and updated ecological research provides huge information on ecosystem management, including biodiversity aspects. Ethnoecology is an emergent field that focuses on local peoples\&\#39; perception and management of complex and co-evolved relationships between the cultural, ecological, and economic components of anthropogenic and natural ecosystems.In the present book, the Zambezian wild edible products are treated according to fourteen items (from fungi, plants and honey, to beverages and salt, through mammals, birds, fish, insects and other animals). Some other comments concern agriculture and ethnoecology. All together more than a thousand edible products are involved; their ecology, their phenology, as well as their nutritional values are presented and discussed. The iconography is supported by a CD with 387 color photographs.The earlier French version of 1997 has been reviewed and enlarged, taking into account recent progress of knowledge.

  abstract = {This study presents a manually constructed alignment of nearly complete rRNA genes from most animal clades (371 taxa from {$\sim$}33 of the {$\sim$}36 metazoan phyla), expanded from the 197 sequences in a previous study. This thorough, taxon-rich alignment, available at http://www.wsu.edu/{\textasciitilde}jmallatt/research/rRNAalignment.html and in the Dryad Repository (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1v62kr3q), is based rigidly on the secondary structure of the SSU and LSU rRNA molecules, and is annotated in detail, including labeling of the erroneous sequences (contaminants). The alignment can be used for future studies of the molecular evolution of rRNA. Here, we use it to explore if the larger number of sequences produces an improved phylogenetic tree of animal relationships. Disappointingly, the resolution did not improve, neither when the standard maximum-likelihood method was used, nor with more sophisticated methods that partitioned the rRNA into paired and unpaired sites (stem, loop, bulge, junction), or accounted for the evolution of the paired sites. For example, no doublet model of paired-site substitutions (16-state, 16A and 16B, 7A--F, or 6A--C models) corrected the placement of any rogue taxa or increased resolution. The following findings are from the simplest, standard, ML analysis. The 371-taxon tree only imperfectly supported the bilaterian clades of Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, and this problem remained after 17 taxa with unstably positioned sequences were omitted from the analysis. The problem seems to stem from base-compositional heterogeneity across taxa and from an overrepresentation of highly divergent sequences among the newly added taxa (e.g., sequences from Cephalopoda, Rotifera, Acoela, and Myxozoa). The rogue taxa continue to concentrate in two locations in the rRNA tree: near the base of Arthropoda and of Bilateria. The approximately uncertain (AU) test refuted the monophyly of Mollusca and of Chordata, probably due to long-branch attraction of the highly divergent cephalopod and urochordate sequences out of those clades. Unlikely to be correct, these refutations show for the first time that rRNA phylogeny can support some `wrong' clades. Along with its weaknesses, the rRNA tree has strengths: It recovers many clades that are supported by independent evidence (e.g., Metazoa, Bilateria, Hexapoda, Nonoculata, Ambulacraria, Syndermata, and Thecostraca with Malacostraca) and shows good resolution within certain groups (e.g., in Platyhelminthes, Insecta, Cnidaria). As another strength, the newly added rRNA sequences yielded the first rRNA-based support for Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla (dolphin+llama) in Mammalia, for basic subdivisions of Bryozoa (`Gymnolaemata+Stenolaemata' versus Phylactolaemata), and for Oligostraca (ostracods+branchiurans+pentastomids+mystacocarids). Future improvement could come from better sequence-evolution models that account for base-compositional heterogeneity, and from combining rRNA with protein-coding genes in phylogenetic reconstruction.},

The vast majority of the diversity described was represented by rare OTUs ({$\leq$} 0.01\% of reads) belonging primarily to Cryptomycota, Dikarya and photosynthetic organisms, which were never detected as abundant in any of the samples. The small eukaryote community was characterized by a continual and important reassembly. These rearrangements involved the 20 `core taxa' ({$\geq$} 1\% of reads), and, were essentially due to a handful of OTUs that were detected in intermediate abundance (0.01--1\% of reads) and sporadically in dominant taxa. Putative bacterivorous (Ciliophora and Cercozoa) as well as parasitic and saprotrophic taxa (Perkinsozoa and Cryptomycota) were involved in these changes of diversity. A putative infection of microalgae by a lacustrine perkinsozoan was also reported for the first time in this study. Open questions regarding both the patterns that govern the rapid small eukaryote reassemblies and the possible biogeography of these organisms arise from this study.},

  abstract = {Microbial enzyme diversity is a key to understand many ecosystem processes. Whole metagenome sequencing (WMG) obtains information on functional genes, but it is costly and inefficient due to large amount of sequencing that is required. In this study, we have applied a captured metagenomics technique for functional genes in soil microorganisms, as an alternative to WMG. Large-scale targeting of functional genes, coding for enzymes related to organic matter degradation, was applied to two agricultural soil communities through captured metagenomics. Captured metagenomics uses custom-designed, hybridization-based oligonucleotide probes that enrich functional genes of interest in metagenomic libraries where only probe-bound DNA fragments are sequenced. The captured metagenomes were highly enriched with targeted genes while maintaining their target diversity and their taxonomic distribution correlated well with the traditional ribosomal sequencing. The captured metagenomes were highly enriched with genes related to organic matter degradation; at least five times more than similar, publicly available soil WMG projects. This target enrichment technique also preserves the functional representation of the soils, thereby facilitating comparative metagenomics projects. Here, we present the first study that applies the captured metagenomics approach in large scale, and this novel method allows deep investigations of central ecosystem processes by studying functional gene abundances.},

  abstract = {Molecular-based approaches to assess microbial biomass and diversity from soil and other ecosystems are rapidly becoming the standard methodology for analysis. While these techniques are advantageous, because they do not rely on the need to culture organisms, each technique may have its own biases and/or limitations when used to assess fungal diversity from mixed-template samples. In this study, we analyzed PCR specificity and efficiency of the ITS primers (ITS1F and ITS4) in a series of single- and mixed-template samples using a combined quantitative PCR--length heterogeneity analysis (LH-qPCR) approach. As expected, these primers successfully amplified all higher fungal species tested (10 ascomycetes, 6 basidiomycetes, and 4 zygomycetes) and no members of the oomycetes. Based on our results, and a search of the GenBank database, amplicons of the ITS1F and ITS4 primer set exhibit considerable variability (420 to 825~bp), but due to similarities in amplicon sizes of some fungal species, actual species diversity in environmental samples may be underestimated approximately two-fold. The addition of an initial qPCR step allowed for the accurate quantitation of total fungal DNA in mixed-template samples over five orders of magnitude (10-1 to 103~pg {$\mu$}l-1). PCR biases between individuals in mixed-templates rendered it impossible to determine the absolute quantity of any individual within a population from its individual peak height. However, relative changes in individuals within a mixed-template sample could be determined due to a constant proportionality between peak heights and starting template concentration. Variability associated with the individual steps of the LH-qPCR analysis was also determined from environmental samples.},

  abstract = {The recent introduction of molecular techniques in eukaryotic microbial diversity studies, in particular those based in the amplification and sequencing of small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), has revealed the existence of an unexpected variety of new phylotypes. The taxonomic ascription of the organisms bearing those sequences is generally deduced from phylogenetic analysis. Unfortunately, the SSU rDNA sequence alone has often not enough phylogenetic information to resolve the phylogeny of fast-evolving or very divergent sequences, leading to their misclassification. To address this problem, we tried to increase the phylogenetic signal by amplifying the complete eukaryotic rDNA cluster [i.e. the SSU rDNA, the internal transcribed spacers, the 5.8S rDNA and the large-subunit (LSU) rDNA] from environmental samples, and sequencing the SSU and LSU rDNA part of the clones. Using marine planktonic samples, we showed that surveys based on either SSU or SSU + LSU rDNA retrieved comparable diversity patterns. In addition, phylogenetic trees based on the concatenated SSU + LSU rDNA sequences showed better resolution, yielding good support for major eukaryotic groups such as the Opisthokonta, Rhizaria and Excavata. Finally, highly divergent SSU rDNA sequences, whose phylogenetic position was impossible to determine with the SSU rDNA data alone, could be placed correctly with the SSU + LSU rDNA approach. These results suggest that this method can be useful, in particular for the analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities rich in phylotypes of difficult phylogenetic ascription.},

Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20--300{\texttimes} faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10--100{\texttimes} faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.},

  abstract = {Pairwise sequence alignment remains a fundamental problem in computational biology and bioinformatics. Recent advances in genomics and sequencing technologies demand faster and scalable algorithms that can cope with the ever-increasing sequence lengths. Classical pairwise alignment algorithms based on dynamic programming are strongly limited by quadratic requirements in time and memory. The recently proposed wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA) introduced an efficient algorithm to perform exact gap-affine alignment in O(ns) time, where s is the optimal score and n is the sequence length. Notwithstanding these bounds, WFA's O(s2) memory requirements become computationally impractical for genome-scale alignments, leading to a need for further improvement.In this article, we present the bidirectional WFA algorithm, the first gap-affine algorithm capable of computing optimal alignments in O(s) memory while retaining WFA's time complexity of O(ns). As a result, this work improves the lowest known memory bound O(n) to compute gap-affine alignments. In practice, our implementation never requires more than a few hundred MBs aligning noisy Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads up to 1 Mbp long while maintaining competitive execution times.All code is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/BiWFA-paper.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Considerable time and effort can be saved by simultaneously amplifying multiple sequences in a single reaction, a process referred to as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multiplex PCR requires that primers lead to amplification of unique regions of DNA, both in individual pairs and in combinations of many primers, under a single set of reaction conditions. In addition, methods must be available for the analysis of each individual amplification product from the mixture of all the products. Multiplex PCR is becoming a rapid and convenient screening assay in both the clinical and the research laboratory. The development of an efficient multiplex PCR usually requires strategic planning and multiple attempts to optimize reaction conditions. For a successful multiplex PCR assay, the relative concentration of the primers, concentration of the PCR buffer, balance between the magnesium chloride and deoxynucleotide concentrations, cycling temperatures, and amount of template DNA and Taq DNA polymerase are important. An optimal combination of annealing temperature and buffer concentration is essential in multiplex PCR to obtain highly specific amplification products. Magnesium chloride concentration needs only to be proportional to the amount of dNTP, while adjusting primer concentration for each target sequence is also essential. The list of various factors that can influence the reaction is by no means complete. Optimization of the parameters discussed in the present review should provide a practical approach toward resolving the common problems encountered in multiplex PCR (such as spurious amplification products, uneven or no amplification of some target sequences, and difficulties in reproducing some results). Thorough evaluation and validation of new multiplex PCR procedures is essential. The sensitivity and specificity must be thoroughly evaluated using standardized purified nucleic acids. Where available, full use should be made of external and internal quality controls, which must be rigorously applied. As the number of microbial agents detectable by PCR increases, it will become highly desirable for practical purposes to achieve simultaneous detection of multiple agents that cause similar or identical clinical syndromes and/or share similar epidemiological features.

However, metabarcoding can be conducted through several approaches, and the consistency of results across methods has rarely been studied. We compare the results obtained by DNA metabarcoding of the same communities using two different markers -- COI and 16S -- and three different sampling methods: (a) homogenized Malaise trap samples (homogenate), (b) preservative ethanol from the same samples, and (c) soil samples. Our results indicate that COI and 16S offer partly complementary information on Malaise trap samples, with each marker detecting a significant number of species not detected by the other. Different sampling methods offer highly divergent estimates of community composition. The community recovered from preservative ethanol of Malaise trap samples is significantly different from that recovered from homogenate. Small and weakly sclerotized insects tend to be overrepresented in ethanol while strong and large taxa are overrepresented in homogenate. For soil samples, highly degenerate COI primers pick up large amounts of nontarget DNA and only 16S provides adequate analyses of insect diversity. However, even with 16S, very little overlap in molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU) content was found between the trap and the soil samples. Our results demonstrate that none of the tested sampling approaches is satisfactory on its own. For instance, DNA extraction from preservative ethanol is not a valid replacement for destructive bulk extraction but a complement. In future metabarcoding studies, both should ideally be used together to achieve comprehensive representation of the target community.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines.

In P. pinaster plots, total fungal dry weight decreased from 35.3kgha-1 in unburned plots to 1.9kgha-1 in burned plots, where richness, diversity of mycorrhizal species and production of edible fungi were significantly lower. Dry weight for mycorrhizal species was higher than for saprophytic fungi in the unburned treatments (75\% and 25\% of the total, respectively), but it was not significantly different in burned areas (56\% and 44\%). In C. ladanifer plots, mycorrhizal species diversity was higher than that for saprophytic species. However, diversity of total, mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungal species was significantly lower in burned plots. An overall decrease of richness was also observed in these plots. Fire significantly increased the abundance of the pyrophytic mycorrhizal species Leccinum corsicum, whereas Boletus edulis, usually associated with C. ladanifer in northwestern Spain, was not found in burned plots. Some mycorrhizal fungi associated with C. ladanifer are common to Pinus forests, so these pyrophytic shrubs can play an important role in the regeneration of P. pinaster stands after wildfire.},

Efficient extraction of free ergosterol is achieved with ethanol and ergosterol is then quantified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. This procedure is suitable for estimating ergosterol levels from many fungal isolates. The procedure has been scaled down allowing fungal infection to be measured in a few ectomycorrhizas. The assay is more sensitive, rapid, and convenient than chitin assay in measuring ectomycorrhizal fungus biomass. The development of symbiotic tissues and extent of fungal colonization in Eucalyptus globulus-Pisolithus tinctorius ectomycorrhizas measured by an ergosterol assay was compared to chitin assay. Ergosterol assay was more sensitive in measuring early growth of the fungal partner.},

The evolutionary value of recombination has been widely debated and so too has its influence on evolutionary analysis methods that assume nucleotide sequences replicate without recombining. When nucleic acids recombine, the evolution of the daughter or recombinant molecule cannot be accurately described by a single phylogeny. This simple fact can seriously undermine the accuracy of any phylogenetics-based analytical approach which assumes that the evolutionary history of a set of recombining sequences can be adequately described by a single phylogenetic tree. There are presently a large number of available methods and associated computer programs for analyzing and characterizing recombination in various classes of nucleotide sequence datasets. Here we examine the use of some of these methods to derive and test recombination hypotheses using multiple sequence alignments.},

Despite their economic and ecological importance, models that describe the influence of different factors on mushroom yield are few. These models would support multi-objective forest management and planning that takes into account mushroom production. This study aims at providing models for predicting the total yield of wild ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and, especially, of L. group deliciosus and B. edulis. Mushroom data were collected in 18 permanent plots in pure even-aged Pinus sylvestris stands during fifteen consecutive years. Variables describing weather conditions, stand structure and local site characteristics were used as predictors in the modeling process. Rainfall and temperature were significant predictors in all the fitted models. In addition, the total yield of ectomycorrhizal fungi was significantly affected by dominant height and stand age. The production of L. group deliciosus was influenced by dominant height and stand basal area. The equation fitted for B. edulis, to our knowledge, is the first model for this species. It shows that stand basal area is a strong factor influencing the yield. The equations presented in this study enable predictions of mushroom yield under different forest management schedules and climatic scenarios.},

  abstract = {A fast and reliable method for obtaining a species-level identification is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of activities, from plant protection and invasive species management to biodiversity assessments and ecological studies. For insects, novel molecular techniques such as DNA metabarcoding have emerged as a rapid alternative to traditional morphological identification, reducing the dependence on limited taxonomic experts. Until recently, molecular techniques have required a destructive DNA extraction, precluding the possibility of preserving voucher specimens for future studies, or species descriptions. Here we paired insect metabarcoding with two recent non-destructive DNA extraction protocols, to obtain a rapid and high-throughput taxonomic identification of diverse insect taxa while retaining a physical voucher specimen. The aim of this work was to explore how non-destructive extraction protocols impact the semi-quantitative nature of metabarcoding, which alongside species presence/absence also provides a quantitative, but biased, representation of their relative abundances. By using a series of mock communities representing each stage of a typical metabarcoding workflow we were able to determine how different morphological (i.e., insect biomass and exoskeleton hardness) and molecular traits (i.e., primer mismatch and amplicon GC\%), interact with different protocol steps to introduce quantitative bias into non-destructive metabarcoding results. We discuss the relevance of taxonomic bias to metabarcoding identification of insects and potential approaches to account for it.},

In regions threatened by exotic species invasion and lacking native wild grazers, however, cattle may produce the type of disturbance that helps maintain diverse communities. Across 72 vernal pools, I examined the effect of different grazing treatments (ungrazed, continuously grazed, wet-season grazed and dry-season grazed) on vernal-pool plant and aquatic faunal diversity in the Central Valley of California. After 3 years of treatment, ungrazed pools had 88\% higher cover of exotic annual grasses and 47\% lower relative cover of native species than pools grazed at historical levels (continuously grazed). Species richness of native plants declined by 25\% and aquatic invertebrate richness was 28\% lower in the ungrazed compared with the continuously grazed treatments. Release from grazing reduced pool inundation period by 50 to 80\%, making it difficult for some vernal-pool endemic species to complete their life cycle. My results show that one should not assume livestock and ranching operations are necessarily damaging to native communities. In my central California study site, grazing helped maintain native plant and aquatic diversity in vernal pools.},

The speed and simplicity of this method make it ideally suited for molecular applications, both within and outside the laboratory, including limited-resource settings such as remote field sites and teaching institutions.

  abstract = {Molecular surveys in planktonic marine systems have unveiled a large novel diversity of small protists. A large part of this diversity belongs to basal heterotrophic stramenopiles and is distributed in a set of polyphyletic ribogroups (described from rDNA sequences) collectively named as MAST (MArine STramenopiles). In the few groups investigated, MAST cells are globally distributed and abundant bacterial grazers, therefore having a putatively large impact on marine ecosystem functioning. The main aim of this study is to reevaluate the MAST ribogroups described so far and to determine whether additional groups can be found. For this purpose, we used traditional and state-of-the-art molecular tools, combining 18S rDNA sequences from publicly available clone libraries, single amplified genomes (SAGs) of planktonic protists, and a pyrosequencing survey from coastal waters and sediments. Our analysis indicated a final set of 18 MAST groups plus 5 new ribogroups within Ochrophyta (named as MOCH). The MAST ribogroups were then analyzed in more detail. Seven were typical of anoxic systems and one of oxic sediments. The rest were clearly members of oxic marine picoplankton. We characterized the genetic diversity within each MAST group and defined subclades for the more diverse (46 subclades in 8 groups). The analyses of sequences within subclades revealed further ecological specializations. Our data provide a renovated framework for phylogenetic classification of the numerous MAST ribogroups and support the notion of a tight link between phylogeny and ecological distribution. These diverse and largely uncultured protists are widespread and ecologically relevant members of marine microbial assemblages.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are part of the most widespread fungal-plant symbiosis. They colonize at least 80\% of plant species, promote plant growth and plant diversity. These fungi are multinucleated and display either one or two nucleus genotypes (monokaryon and dikaryon) determined by a putative mating-type locus. This taxon has been considered as an ancient asexual scandal because of the lack of observable sexual structures. Despite the identification of a putative mating-type (MAT-type) locus and the functional activation of genes related to mating when two isolates co-exist, it is still unknown if AMF display a sexual or a parasexual life cycle. To test if AMF genomes display signatures of a sexual life-cycle involving the putative MAT-locus, we used publicly available genome sequences to test if recombining nucleotype-specific haplotypes could be identified using short-read Illumina sequences. We identified nucleus genotype-specific haplotypes within dikaryons and compared them to orthologous gene sequences from related monokaryon isolates displaying similar putative MAT-types. We show that haplotypes within a dikaryon isolate are more similar to homologue sequences of isolates having the same MAT-type than among them. We demonstrate that these genotype-specific haplotypes are recombinant, and are not consistently most similar to the monokaryon isolate sharing the same mating-type allele. These results are consistent with a sexual origin of the dikaryon rather than a parasexual origin and provides an important step to understand the life cycle of these globally important symbiotic fungi.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The two data sets, though not significantly incongruent, exhibit conflict among the placement of two taxa that exhibit long branches in the nLSU data set. In contrast, RPB1 terminal branch lengths are rather uniform. Bootstrap support is increased for clades in RPB1. Combined data sets increase the degree of confidence for several relationships. Overall, nLSU data do not yield a robust phylogeny when independently assessed by RPB1 sequences. This multigene study indicates that Inocybe is a monophyletic group composed of at least four distinct lineages---subgenus Mallocybe, section Cervicolores, section Rimosae, and subgenus Inocybe sensu K{\"u}hner, Kuyper, non Singer. Within subgenus Inocybe, two additional lineages, one composed of species with smooth basidiospores (clade I) and a second characterized by nodulose-spored species (clade II), are recovered by RPB1 and combined data. The nLSU data recover only clade I. The genera Astrosporina and Inocybella cannot be recognized phylogenetically. ``Supersections'' Cortinatae and Marginatae are not monophyletic groups.},

  abstract = {Approximately 3000 bp across 84 taxa have been analyzed for variable regions of RPB1, RPB2, and nLSU-rDNA to infer phylogenetic relationships in the large ectomycorrhizal mushroom genus Inocybe (Agaricales; Basidiomycota). This study represents the first effort to combine variable regions of RPB1 and RPB2 with nLSU-rDNA for low-level phylogenetic studies in mushroom-forming fungi. Combination of the three loci increases non-parametric bootstrap support, Bayesian posterior probabilities, and resolution for numerous clades compared to separate gene analyses. These data suggest the evolution of at least five major lineages in Inocybe---the Inocybe clade, the Mallocybe clade, the Auritella clade, the Inosperma clade, and the Pseudosperma clade. Additionally, many clades nested within each major lineage are strongly supported. These results also suggest the family Crepiodataceae sensu stricto is sister to Inocybe. Recognition of Inocybe at the family level, the Inocybaceae, is recommended.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim? The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mushroom family Inocybaceae is widespread in north temperate regions, but more than 150 species are encountered in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. The relative roles of recent and ancient biogeographical processes, relationships with plant hosts, and the timing of divergences that have shaped the current geographic distribution of the family are investigated. Location? Africa, Australia, Neotropics, New Zealand, north temperate zone, Palaeotropics, Southeast Asia, South America, south temperate zone. Methods? We reconstruct a phylogeny of the Inocybaceae with a geological timeline using a relaxed molecular clock. Divergence dates of lineages are estimated statistically to test vicariance-based hypotheses concerning relatedness of disjunct ECM taxa. A series of internal maximum time constraints is used to evaluate two different calibrations. Ancestral state reconstruction is used to infer ancestral areas and ancestral plant partners of the family. Results? The Palaeotropics are unique in containing representatives of all major clades of Inocybaceae. Six of the seven major clades diversified initially during the Cretaceous, with subsequent radiations probably during the early Palaeogene. Vicariance patterns cannot be rejected that involve area relationships for Africa?Australia, Africa?India and southern South America?Australia. Northern and southern South America, Australia and New Zealand are primarily the recipients of immigrant taxa during the Palaeogene or later. Angiosperms were the earliest hosts of Inocybaceae. Transitions to conifers probably occurred no earlier than 65?Ma. Main conclusions? The Inocybaceae initially diversified no later than the Cretaceous in Palaeotropical settings, in association with angiosperms. Diversification within major clades of the family accelerated during the Palaeogene in north and south temperate regions, whereas several relictual lineages persisted in the tropics. Both vicariance and dispersal patterns are detected. Species from Neotropical and south temperate regions are largely derived from immigrant ancestors from north temperate or Palaeotropical regions. Transitions to conifer hosts occurred later, probably during the Palaeogene.},

  abstract = {A six-gene phylogeny of the Inocybaceae is presented to address classification of major clades within the family. Seven genera are recognized that establish a global overview of phylogenetic relationships in the Inocybaceae. Two genera---Nothocybe and Pseudosperma---are described as new. Two subgenera of Inocybe---subg. Inosperma and subg. Mallocybe---are elevated to generic rank. These four new genera, together with the previously described Auritella, Tubariomyces, and now Inocybe sensu stricto, constitute the Inocybaceae, an ectomycorrhizal lineage of Agaricales that associates with at least 23 plant families worldwide. Pseudosperma, Nothocybe, and Inocybe are recovered as a strongly supported inclusive clade within the family. The genus Nothocybe, represented by a single species from tropical India, is strongly supported as the sister lineage to Inocybe, a hyperdiverse genus containing hundreds of species and global distribution. Two additional inclusive clades, including Inosperma, Tubariomyces, Auritella, and Mallocybe, and a nested grouping of Auritella, Mallocybe, and Tubariomyces, are recovered but with marginal statistical support. Overall, the six-gene data set provides a more robust phylogenetic estimate of relationships within the family than do single-gene and single-gene-region estimates. In addition, Africa, India, and Australia are characterized by the most genera in the family, with South America containing the fewest number of genera. A total of 180 names are recombined or proposed as new in Inosperma, Mallocybe, and Pseudosperma. A key to genera of Inocybaceae is provided.},

The format is lightweight, versatile, extensible, and is based on the JSON format, which can be parsed by most modern programming languages. Our format is already implemented in several tools for computing and post-processing parsimony- and likelihood-based phylogenetic placements and has worked well in practice. We believe that establishing a standard format for analyzing read placements at this early stage will lead to a more efficient development of powerful and portable post-analysis tools for the growing applications of phylogenetic placement.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that changes in community compositions of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi along elevation gradients are mainly affected by changes in host tree communities and/or in abiotic environments. However, few studies have taken the effects of processes related to fungal dispersal (i.e., spatial processes) into account and distinguished the effects of host community, abiotic environment, and spatial processes on community composition along elevation gradients. This has left unclear the relative importance of these factors in structuring the ECM community assemblages. To address this, we investigated the community composition of ECM fungi along an elevation gradient in northern Japan with 454 meta-barcoding. We found that the community composition of ECM fungi changed along the elevation and that all three factors jointly affected the compositional changes. We separated the magnitude of importance of the three factors in structuring ECM fungal communities and found that most part of the spatial variation in ECM fungal community was explained by host communities and abiotic environments. Our results suggest that while biotic and/or abiotic environments can be important factors to determine the ECM fungal community composition along an elevation gradient, spatial processes may also be a primary determinant for the ECM fungal community composition.},

  abstract = {Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both {$\beta$}-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140--142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

Previously, it was shown that outcomes of studies relying on this approach vastly depend on the choice of pre-processing and clustering algorithms used. However, obtaining insights into the effects and accuracy of these algorithms is challenging due to difficulties in generating samples of known composition with high enough diversity. Here, we use in silico microbial datasets to better understand how the experimental data are transformed into taxonomic clusters by computational methods.Results: We were able to qualitatively replicate the raw experimental pyrosequencing data after rigorously adjusting existing simulation software. This allowed us to simulate datasets of real-life complexity, which we used to assess the influence and performance of two widely used pre-processing methods along with 11 clustering algorithms. We show that the choice, order and mode of the pre-processing methods have a larger impact on the accuracy of the clustering pipeline than the clustering methods themselves. Without pre-processing, the difference between the performances of clustering methods is large. Depending on the clustering algorithm, the most optimal analysis pipeline resulted in significant underestimations of the expected number of clusters (minimum: 3.4\%; maximum: 13.6\%), allowing us to make quantitative estimations of the bacterial complexity of real microbiome samples.Contact: ~a.may@vu.nl or b.brandt@acta.nlSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

  abstract = {During the last decades, describing, analysing and understanding the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages has been a central theme in both community ecology and macro-ecology. Among the wide variety of phylogenetic structure metrics, three have been predominant in the literature: Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PDFaith), which represents the sum of the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree linking all species of a particular assemblage, the mean pairwise distance between all species in an assemblage (MPD) and the pairwise distance between the closest relatives in an assemblage (MNTD). Comparisons between studies using one or several of these metrics are difficult because there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the phylogenetic properties each metric captures. In particular it is unknown how PDFaith relates to MDP and MNTD. Consequently, it is possible that apparently opposing patterns in different studies might simply reflect differences in metric properties. Here, we aim to fill this gap by comparing these metrics using simulations and empirical data. We first used simulation experiments to test the influence of community structure and size on the mismatch between metrics whilst varying the shape and size of the phylogenetic tree of the species pool. Second we investigated the mismatch between metrics for two empirical datasets (gut microbes and global carnivoran assemblages). We show that MNTD and PDFaith provide similar information on phylogenetic structure, and respond similarly to variation in species richness and assemblage structure. However, MPD demonstrate a very different behaviour, and is highly sensitive to deep branching structure. We suggest that by combining complementary metrics that are sensitive to processes operating at different phylogenetic depths (i.e. MPD and MNTD or PDFaith) we can obtain a better understanding of assemblage structure.},

  abstract = {The algorithms for phylogenetic reconstruction are central to computational molecular evolution. The relentless pace of data acquisition has exposed their poor scalability and the conclusion that the conventional application of these methods is impractical and not justifiable from an energy usage perspective. Furthermore, the drive to improve the statistical performance of phylogenetic methods produces increasingly parameter-rich models of sequence evolution, which worsens the computational performance. Established theoretical and algorithmic results identify supertree methods as critical to divide-and-conquer strategies for improving scalability of phylogenetic reconstruction. Of particular importance is the ability to explicitly accommodating rooted topologies. These can arise from the more biologically plausible non-stationary models of sequence evolution. We make a contribution to addressing this challenge with Spectral Cluster Supertree, a novel supertree method for merging a set of overlapping rooted phylogenetic trees. It offers significant improvements over Min-Cut supertree and previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both time complexity and overall topological accuracy, particularly for problems of large size. We perform comparisons against Min-Cut supertree and Bad Clade Deletion. Leveraging two tree topology distance metrics, we demonstrate that while Bad Clade Deletion generates more correct clades in its resulting supertree, Spectral Cluster Supertree's generated tree is generally more topologically close to the true model tree. Over large datasets containing 10000 taxa and -500 source trees, where Bad Clade Deletion usually takes -2 hours to run, our method generates a supertree in on average 20 seconds. Spectral Cluster Supertree is released under an open source license and is available on the python package index as sc-supertree. This research was undertaken with the assistance of resources and services from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), which is supported by the Australian Government.},

The wetland plant Glyceria fluitans (floating sweetgrass) was found growing in a lead/zine mine-tailings pond. The potential of this species for revegetation of mine tailings under wetland conditions had not previously been investigated. In two outdoor experiments. G. fluitans of non-contaminated origin grew successfully on alkaline tailings containing elevated metal concentrations (230 {$\mu$}mol g-1 Zn, 11 {$\mu$}mol g-1 Pb). Growth of G. fluitans was significantly enhanced on tailings treated with NPK fertilizer (700 kg ha-1), but the plants grew well even without fertilizer, indicating a low nutrient requirement. Glyceria fluitans did not survive on saline (MgSO4) tailings originating from another mine that contained much higher lead (34 {$\mu$}mol g-1) and iron (2584 {$\mu$}mol g-1) concentrations. The ability of G. fluitans to tolerate many of the adverse conditions associated with mine tailings favors its use for revegetation purposes.},

Learning research has demonstrated that visualizing processes in three dimensions aids learning, and animations are effective visualization tools for novice learners and aid with long-term memory retention. The World Wide Web Instructional Committee at North Dakota State University has used these research results as an inspiration to develop a suite of high-quality animations of molecular and cellular processes. Currently, these animations represent transcription, translation, bacterial gene expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA splicing, protein transport into an organelle, the electron transport chain, and the use of a biological gradient to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. These animations are integrated with an educational module that consists of First Look and Advanced Look components that feature captioned stills from the animation representing the key steps in the processes at varying levels of complexity. These animation-based educational modules are available via the World Wide Web at http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations. An in-class research experiment demonstrated that student retention of content material was significantly better when students received a lecture coupled with the animations and then used the animation as an individual study activity.},

  abstract = {Fungi regulate key nutrient cycling processes in many forest ecosystems, but their diversity and distribution within and across ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, we examine the spatial distribution of fungi across a boreal and tropical ecosystem, focusing on ectomycorrhizal fungi. We analyzed fungal community composition across litter (organic horizons) and underlying soil horizons (0--20 cm) using 454 pyrosequencing and clone library sequencing. In both forests, we found significant clustering of fungal communities by site and soil horizons with analogous patterns detected by both sequencing technologies. Free-living saprotrophic fungi dominated the recently-shed leaf litter and ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the underlying soil horizons. This vertical pattern of fungal segregation has also been found in temperate and European boreal forests, suggesting that these results apply broadly to ectomycorrhizal-dominated systems, including tropical rain forests. Since ectomycorrhizal and free-living saprotrophic fungi have different influences on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, information on the spatial distribution of these functional groups will improve our understanding of forest nutrient cycling.},

  abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is a promising technique to enable the use of samples with only limited amount of DNA for the construction of RAD-seq libraries. Previous work has shown that, when the amount of DNA used in the MDA reaction is large, double-digest RAD-seq (ddRAD) libraries prepared with amplified genomic DNA result in data that are indistinguishable from libraries prepared directly from genomic DNA. Based on this observation, here we evaluate the quality of ddRAD libraries prepared from MDA-amplified genomic DNA when the amount of input genomic DNA and the coverage obtained for samples is variable. By simultaneously preparing libraries for five species of weevils (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), we also evaluate the likelihood that potential contaminants will be encountered in the assembled dataset. Overall, our results indicate that MDA may not be able to rescue all samples with small amounts of DNA, but it does produce ddRAD libraries adequate for studies of phylogeography and population genetics even when conditions are not optimal. We find that MDA makes it harder to predict the number of loci that will be obtained for a given sequencing effort, with some samples behaving like traditional libraries and others yielding fewer loci than expected. This seems to be caused both by stochastic and deterministic effects during amplification. Further, the reduction in loci is stronger in libraries with lower amounts of template DNA for the MDA reaction. Even though a few samples exhibit substantial levels of contamination in raw reads, the effect is very small in the final dataset, suggesting that filters imposed during dataset assembly are important in removing contamination. Importantly, samples with strong signs of contamination and biases in heterozygosity were also those with fewer loci shared in the final dataset, suggesting that stringent filtering of samples with significant amounts of missing data is important when assembling data derived from MDA-amplified genomic DNA. Overall, we find that the combination of MDA and ddRAD results in high-quality datasets for population genetics as long as the sequence data is properly filtered during assembly.},

All parameters can be set separately for each percentage of identity threshold, which makes this tool adaptable for different databases, genetic markers and diverse taxonomic groups.

  abstract = {Identification of unknown fungal species aids to the conservation of fungal diversity. As many fungal species cannot be cultured, morphological identification of those species is almost impossible. But, DNA barcoding technique can be employed for identification of such species. For fungal taxonomy prediction, the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region of rDNA (ribosomal DNA) is used as barcode. Though the computational prediction of fungal species has become feasible with the availability of huge volume of barcode sequences in public domain, prediction of fungal species is challenging due to high degree of variability among ITS regions within species.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C{$\prime$}. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only ``sensible'' criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

This chapter focuses on the state of the art in research pertaining to these ectomycorrhizal fungi, from a taxonomic to an ecological point of view. The availability of specific primers for this complex of species has allowed the unambiguous identification of B. edulis Bull.: Fr. sensu stricto, B. aereus Bull.: Fr., B. pinophilus Pil{\'a}t \& Dermek, and B. aestivalis (Paulet) Fr. and has represented a crucial point for the analysis of genetic structure in these fungi, as well as for the production of certified mycelia for long-term reforestation programs focused on increasing bolete production. Field studies show that large amounts of basidiomes result from abundant mycorrhizae and rare mycelia having a scattered distribution. Although the detection of mycorrhizae and extraradical mycelium is feasible at this time, no conclusions can be given yet on bolete population structure or on how they complete their life cycle in time and space. The scheduled sequencing of the B. edulis genome within the Fungal Genomics Program will open new perspectives and understanding on the biology and ecology of this mushroom.},

While these man-made ponds are not intended to serve as freshwater ecosystems, it is becoming clear that they do provide habitat for many organisms, but we know little of their ecosystem structure, function and interactions with pollutants. From April through June 2009, we surveyed 8 stormwater ponds in the Red Run Watershed, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA to describe patterns in aquatic food webs associated with a gradient in road salt inputs. Periphyton, phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were collected from each pond every 4--6 weeks. Specific conductance, a measure of chloride salt loading, among the 8 ponds varied widely throughout the survey, ranging from 99 {$\mu$}S cm-1 to 19,320 {$\mu$}S cm-1. Low (average = 404 +/- 82.6 (SE) {$\mu$}S cm-1) and medium (average = 1749 +/- 267 (SE) {$\mu$}S cm-1) conductance ponds had lower algal biomass and higher densities of zooplankton taxa relative to high (average = 7231 +/- 2143 (SE) {$\mu$}S cm-1) conductance ponds, which were largely devoid of all zooplankton through the end of May. The observed decline in zooplankton density along an increasing chloride gradient is consistent with experimental results of road deicer effects, suggesting algal resources are possibly freed from grazing pressure as zooplankton consumers are negatively impacted by road salt exposure. Our results highlight the potential for both direct and indirect effects of road deicers on freshwater communities.},

  abstract = {Computational methods for predicting evolutionarily conserved rather than thermodynamic RNA structures have recently attracted increased interest. These methods are indispensable not only for elucidating the regulatory roles of known RNA transcripts, but also for predicting RNA genes. It has been notoriously difficult to devise them to make the best use of the available data and to predict high-quality RNA structures that may also contain pseudoknots. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for co-estimating an RNA secondary structure including pseudoknots, a multiple sequence alignment, and an evolutionary tree, given several RNA input sequences. We also present an implementation of the framework in a new computer program, called SimulFold, which employs a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to sample from the joint posterior distribution of RNA structures, alignments, and trees. We use the new framework to predict RNA structures, and comprehensively evaluate the quality of our predictions by comparing our results to those of several other programs. We also present preliminary data that show SimulFold's potential as an alignment and phylogeny prediction method. SimulFold overcomes many conceptual limitations that current RNA structure prediction methods face, introduces several new theoretical techniques, and generates high-quality predictions of conserved RNA structures that may include pseudoknots. It is thus likely to have a strong impact, both on the field of RNA structure prediction and on a wide range of data analyses.},

Our findings reveal how temperature drives fungal compositional turnover (beta diversity) and phylogenetic diversity, linking them with regional species richness (gamma diversity).

Because there have been no molecular phylogenetic studies of the Russulales, attempts at formulating a natural classification for these taxa have met with difficulty. In this study, nuclear large subunit rDNA (n-LSU) was used to infer phylogenetic relationships among members of the Russulales including agaricoid, tropical pleurotoid and annulate taxa, and gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera. Analysis of the n-LSU region indicated that Russula sensu strictu (excluding gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid taxa) can be considered polyphyletic with two well supported groups, one group arising separately from the main body of the tree and one group basal to Lactarius. Russula sensu lato can be considered paraphyletic with gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid forms nested in the same clades alongside agaricoid taxa. Lactarius sensu lato was found to be a monophyletic group that includes agaricoid, gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid taxa. Gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera were scattered throughout the order, with Macowanites, Gymnomyces, Cystangium and Martellia nested within Russula, while Zelleromyces and Arcangeliella grouped within Lactarius. Most of the gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera appear to be polyphyletic and their position was supported within established infrageneric taxa of Russula and Lactarius. These results suggested that synonomy of gasteroid genera into Russula and Lactarius is justifiable.}

  abstract = {Species in the large mushroom genus Russula are important ecologically as ectomycorrhizal fungi and economically as comestibles. Most infrageneric classification schemes of this genus have originated in Europe, but because of nomenclatural history and an evolving suite of characters these systems remain largely incongruent. Using ribosomal DNA sequences for 87 species representing all infrageneric taxa described from Europe, the phylogenetic position and relationships among these species were examined. Cladistic analysis of the ITS1, 5{$\cdot$}8S, and ITS2 regions showed a cluster of five to six small to large clades basal in the topology and one large apical clade arising from the deeper nodes, none of which has been previously recognized in toto at the subgeneric level. Two of these groups, the Compactae and Pallidosporinae, which have been previously recognized as subsections of section Compacta, did not appear to be closely related. Bootstrap support and Bremer decay values indicated that collapse of the tree into monophyly at the deeper nodes would result in two large groups which are consistent with the classical subgeneric concept of the Eurussulae and a narrowed Compactae. The topology confirmed some previously described infrageneric taxa at the section level including the Tenellae and Heterophyllae and at the subsection level including the Cupreinae, Laricinae, Lilaceinae, Integroidinae, Violaceinae, Sphagnophilinae, Viridantinae, Emeticinae, Subvelatae, Pallidosporinae, and portions of the Polychromae and Sardoninae. The molecular analysis also indicated many interesting new combinations or relationships not previously conceived. Mapping of characters such as spore print colour, taste, and presence of acid resistant incrustations, which have been used to define infrageneric taxa in Russula, onto the phylogeny identified interesting patterns consistent with hypotheses regarding plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters. However, because of potential loss or reversal of character states, this analysis did not support their unequivocal use in infrageneric classification.},

  abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary history of living organisms is a central problem in biology. Until recently the ability to infer evolutionary relationships was limited by the amount of DNA sequence data available, but new DNA sequencing technologies have largely removed this limitation. As a result, DNA sequence data are readily available or obtainable for a wide spectrum of organisms, thus creating an unprecedented opportunity to explore evolutionary relationships broadly and deeply across the Tree of Life. Unfortunately, the algorithms used to infer evolutionary relationships are NP-hard, so the dramatic increase in available DNA sequence data has created a commensurate increase in the need for access to powerful computational resources. Local laptop or desktop machines are no longer viable for analysis of the larger data sets available today, and progress in the field relies upon access to large, scalable high-performance computing resources. This paper describes development of the CIPRES Science Gateway, a web portal designed to provide researchers with transparent access to the fastest available community codes for inference of phylogenetic relationships, and implementation of these codes on scalable computational resources. Meeting the needs of the community has included developing infrastructure to provide access, working with the community to improve existing community codes, developing infrastructure to insure the portal is scalable to the entire systematics community, and adopting strategies that make the project sustainable by the community. The CIPRES Science Gateway has allowed more than 1800 unique users to run jobs that required 2.5 million Service Units since its release in December 2009. (A Service Unit is a CPU-hour at unit priority).},

In total, 150 soil cores were collected from three forests on Mt. Ishizuchi, western Japan, and subjected to bioassays using Pinus densiflora and Betula maximowicziana. Using molecular analyses, we recorded 23 EM fungal species in the assayed propagule banks. Eight species (34.8 \%) were shared across the three sites, which ranged from a warm--temperate evergreen mixed forest to a subalpine conifer forest. The elevation pattern of the assayed propagule banks differed dramatically from that of EM fungi on existing roots along the same gradient, where only a small proportion of EM fungal species (3.5 \%) were shared across sites. The EM fungal species found in the assayed propagule banks included many pioneer fungal species and composition differed significantly from that on existing roots. Furthermore, only 4 of 23 species were shared between the two host species, indicating a strong effect of bioassay host identity in determining the propagule banks of EM fungi. These results imply that the assayed propagule bank is less affected by climate compared to EM fungal communities on existing roots. The dominance of disturbance-dependent fungal species in the assayed propagule banks may result in higher ecosystem resilience to disturbance even in old-growth temperate forests.},

  abstract = {The establishment of common mycelial networks by mycorrhizal fungi shared between host plants depends on the ability of neighboring plants to enter into mycorrhizal associations with compatible fungal species. Such compatibility is governed by the potential mycorrhiza specificities of the symbionts. Mycorrhiza specificities exist along a continuum from low specificity (association with multiple partners) to high specificity (association with one or few partners). Although the ability of symbionts to form mycorrhizas may be largely governed by host-fungus gene interactions as influenced by co-evolutionary events, mycorrhizal associations in natural ecosystems can also be influenced by environmental factors (e.g. soil) and biological factors (e.g. different neighboring host species), phenomena referred to as ``ecological specificity.'' For example, in natural settings, mycorrhizal fungi often express ``host preference'' wherein fungi may be more common on a particular host in mixed-host settings than would be expected by random species assemblage within the fungal and plant communities. Mycorrhiza specificity phenomena significantly influence plant community dynamics, particularly plant succession. Early seral plants can positively affect the establishment of later-seral plants by maintaining commonly shared mycorrhizal fungi, and thus affecting the function of common mycelial networks over time. Such knowledge provides guidance for ecosystem managers to maintain ``legacy'' early -seral plants that benefit later-seral plants via shared mycorrhizal fungus species. Understanding specificity phenomena is also crucial for predicting the successful migration of plants and compatible mycorrhizal fungi during climate change. We review mycorrhiza specificity terminology and types of specificity phenomena, and suggest use of common terms to provide consistency in addressing this research topic. We also provide extensive examples from diverse ecosystems on the ability (or inability) of neighboring plants to develop common mycelial networks.},

  abstract = {Divide-and-conquer methods, which divide the species set into overlapping subsets, construct trees on the subsets, and then combine the trees using a supertree method, provide a key algorithmic framework for boosting the scalability of phylogeny estimation methods to large datasets. Yet the use of supertree methods, which typically attempt to solve NP-hard optimization problems, limits the scalability of these approaches. In this paper, we present a new divide-and-conquer approach that does not require supertree estimation: we divide the species set into disjoint subsets, construct trees on the subsets, and then combine the trees using a distance matrix computed on the full species set. For this merger step, we present a new method, called NJMerge, which is a polynomial-time extension of the Neighbor Joining algorithm. We report on the results of an extensive simulation study evaluating NJMerge's utility in scaling three popular species tree estimation methods: ASTRAL, SVDquartets, and concatenation analysis using RAxML. We find that NJMerge provides substantial improvements in running time without sacrificing accuracy and sometimes even improves accuracy. Furthermore, although NJMerge can sometimes fail to return a tree, the failure rate in our experiments is less than 1\%. Together, these results suggest that NJMerge is a valuable technique for scaling computationally intensive methods to larger datasets, especially when computational resources are limited. NJMerge is freely available on Github: https://github.com/ekmolloy/njmerge.

  abstract = {At RECOMB-CG 2018, we presented NJMerge and showed that it could be used within a divide-and-conquer framework to scale computationally intensive methods for species tree estimation to larger datasets. However, NJMerge has two significant limitations: it can fail to return a tree and, when used within the proposed divide-and-conquer framework, has O(n5) running time for datasets with n species.Here we present a new method called `TreeMerge' that improves on NJMerge in two ways: it is guaranteed to return a tree and it has dramatically faster running time within the same divide-and-conquer framework---only O(n2) time. We use a simulation study to evaluate TreeMerge in the context of multi-locus species tree estimation with two leading methods, ASTRAL-III and RAxML. We find that the divide-and-conquer framework using TreeMerge has a minor impact on species tree accuracy, dramatically reduces running time, and enables both ASTRAL-III and RAxML to complete on datasets (that they would otherwise fail on), when given 64 GB of memory and 48\,h maximum running time. Thus, TreeMerge is a step toward a larger vision of enabling researchers with limited computational resources to perform large-scale species tree estimation, which we call Phylogenomics for All.TreeMerge is publicly available on Github (http://github.com/ekmolloy/treemerge).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {This study provides a first broad systematic treatment of the euagarics as they have recently emerged in phylogenetic systematics. The sample consists of 877 homobasidiomycete taxa and includes approximately one tenth (ca. 700 species) of the known number of species of gilled mushrooms that were traditionally classified in the order Agaricales. About 1000 nucleotide sequences at the 5{$\prime$} end of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit gene (nLSU) were produced for each taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence data employed unequally weighted parsimony and bootstrap methods. Clades revealed by the analyses support the recognition of eight major groups of homobasidiomycetes that cut across traditional lines of classification, in agreement with other recent phylogenetic studies. Gilled fungi comprise the majority of species in the euagarics clade. However, the recognition of a monophyletic euagarics results in the exclusion from the clade of several groups of gilled fungi that have been traditionally classified in the Agaricales and necessitates the inclusion of several clavaroid, poroid, secotioid, gasteroid, and reduced forms that were traditionally classified in other basidiomycete orders. A total of 117 monophyletic groups (clades) of euagarics can be recognized on the basis on nLSU phylogeny. Though many clades correspond to traditional taxonomic groups, many do not. Newly discovered phylogenetic affinities include for instance relationships of the true puffballs (Lycoperdales) with Agaricaceae, of Panellus and the poroid fungi Dictyopanus and Favolaschia with Mycena, and of the reduced fungus Caripia with Gymnopus. Several clades are best supported by ecological, biochemical, or trophic habits rather than by morphological similarities.},

  abstract = {We reassessed the circumscription of the cantharelloid clade and identified monophyletic groups by using nLSU, nSSU, mtSSU and RPB2 sequence data. Results agreed with earlier studies that placed the genera Cantharellus, Craterellus, Hydnum, Clavulina, Membranomyces, Multiclavula, Sistotrema, Botryobasidium and the family Ceratobasidiaceae in that clade. Phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of all genera except Sistotrema, which was highly polyphyletic. Strongly supported monophyletic groups were: (i) Cantharellus-Craterellus, Hydnum, and the Sistotrema confluens group; (ii) Clavulina-Membranomyces and the S. brinkmannii-oblongisporum group, with Multiclavula being possibly sister of that clade; (iii) the Sistotrema eximum-octosporum group; (iv) Sistotrema adnatum and S. coronilla. Positions of Sistotrema raduloides and S. athelioides were unresolved, as were basal relationships. Botryobasidium was well supported as the sister taxon of all the above taxa, while Ceratobasidiaceae was the most basal lineage. The relationship between Tulasnella and members of the cantharelloid clade will require further scrutiny, although there is cumulative evidence that they are probably sister groups. The rates of molecular evolution of both the large and small nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (nuc-rDNA) are much higher in Cantharellus, Craterellus and Tulasnella than in the other cantharelloid taxa, and analyses of nuc-rDNA sequences strongly placed Tulasnella close to Cantharellus-Craterellus. In contrast analyses with RPB2 and mtSSU sequences placed Tulasnella at the base of the cantharelloid clade. Our attempt to reconstruct a ``supertree'' from tree topologies resulting from separate analyses that avoided phylogenetic reconstruction problems associated with missing data and/or unalignable sequences proved unsuccessful.},

  abstract = {Monoculture rubber cultivation and its intensive associated human activities are known to have a negative impact on the biodiversity, ecology, and biological conservation of the ecosystems in which they occur. These negative impacts include changes to the biodiversity and function of soil fungal communities, which contribute towards nutrient cycling and interact with other organisms in belowground ecosystems, and may be pathogens. Despite the important role of soil fungi in rubber plantations, these communities have been poorly studied. In this paper, we review the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of belowground fungi in rubber plantations. Various groups of soil fungi, including saprobes, symbionts, and pathogens are discussed. Additionally, the role of plantation management is discussed in the context of both pathogenic soil fungi and the promotion of beneficial soil fungi. Management practices include clone selection, tree age and planting density, application of chemicals, and intercropping systems. Our review shows the strong need for further research into the effects of monoculture rubber plantations on soil fungal communities, and how we can best manage these systems in the future, in order to create a more sustainable approach to rubber production.},

  abstract = {Determination of fungal biomass (FB) and FB-carbon (FB-C) from soil ergosterol concentration is difficult because of unknown ergosterol-to-fungal biomass (E-to-FB) conversion factors and inefficient ergosterol extraction methods. We applied a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure to measure ergosterol in soil samples. The E-to-FB conversion factors were determined in six species of fungi grown in vitro. The MAE method was fast and extracted up to nine times more soil ergosterol than a classical refluxing saponification method. Soil ergosterol was separated and quantified rapidly ({$<$}10 min) by HPLC. Alternaria alternata, Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillum chrysogenum, Rhizopus stolonifer and Trichoderma harzianum isolated from soil and plant matrices were grown in batch. Ergosterol and biomass content were determined in mycelia harvested during the stationary and exponential phases of growth. Total mycelial ergosterol ranged from 180 to 2178 {$\mu$}g, and total dry biomass ranged from 17 to 595 mg. Total ergosterol and fungal dry biomass were strongly associated (r2 = 0.95). The C content in mycelial mats averaged 43\% ({\textpm}1.1, SD), and was similar among fungal species and growth phases. The analyses of variance showed that the E-to-FB ratio was similar among fungal species or growth phase. An average ergosterol concentration of 4 {$\mu$}g mg-1 dry biomass was determined for the six species of fungi, which gave a conversion factor of 250 {$\mu$}g dry biomass {$\mu$}g-1 ergosterol. The MAE method recovered an average of 62\% ({\textpm}11\%, SD) of the ergosterol added in mycelial mats to soils prior to extraction, and its recovery was independent of soil properties. The E-to-FB ratio and percent recovery of mycelial ergosterol helped establish for the first time relationships determining soil FB and FB-C from soil ergosterol concentration. The amount of FB ranged from 155 to 4745 {$\mu$}g g-1 and that for FB-C ranged from 67 to 2040 {$\mu$}g g-1 for different soils, and was higher in samples taken from native undisturbed land than in samples taken from adjacent cultivated fields. Measurement of soil ergosterol concentration is a useful estimate content of the living soil FB.},

Native Taq polymerases had similar extension rates of 10--45 nt/s. Three alternative polymerases showed faster speeds, including KOD (76 nt/s), Klentaq I (101 nt/s), and KAPA2G (155 nt/s). Fusion polymerases including Herculase II and Phusion were relatively slow (3--13 nt/s). The pH optimum for Klentaq extension was between 8.5 and 8.7 with no effect of Tris concentration. Activity was directly correlated to the MgCl2 concentration and inversely correlated to the KCl concentration. This continuous assay is relevant to PCR and provides accurate measurement of polymerase activity using a defined template without the need of radiolabeled substrates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radioactive DNA polymerase activity methods are cumbersome and do not provide initial extension rates. A simple extension rate assay would enable study of basic assumptions about PCR and define the limits of rapid PCR. METHODS: A continuous assay that monitors DNA polymerase extension using noncovalent DNA dyes on common real-time PCR instruments was developed. Extension rates were measured in nucleotides per second per molecule of polymerase. To initiate the reaction, a nucleotide analog was heat activated at 95 {$^\circ$}C for 5 min, the temperature decreased to 75 {$^\circ$}C, and fluorescence monitored until substrate exhaustion in 30 --90 min. RESULTS: The assay was linear with time for over 40\% of the reaction and for polymerase concentrations over a 100-fold range (1--100 pmol/L). Extension rates decreased continuously with increasing monovalent cation concentrations (lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, and ammonium). Melting-temperature depressors had variable effects. DMSO increased rates up to 33\%, whereas glycerol had little effect. Betaine, formamide, and 1,2propanediol decreased rates with increasing concentrations. Four common noncovalent DNA dyes inhibited polymerase extension. Heat-activated nucleotide analogs were 92\% activated after 5 min, and hot start DNA polymerases were 73\%--90\% activated after 20 min. CONCLUSIONS: Simple DNA extension rate assays can be performed on real-time PCR instruments. Activity is decreased by monovalent cations, DNA dyes, and most melting temperature depressors. Rational inclusion of PCR components on the basis of their effects on polymerase extension is likely to be useful in PCR, particularly rapid-cycle or fast PCR.},

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts {\textasciitilde}8.7 million ({\textpm} 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which {\textasciitilde}2.2 million ({\textpm} 0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86\% of existing species on Earth and 91\% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

  abstract = {Resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among the major eukaryotic groups is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology that is still only partially solved. This task was initially addressed using a single marker, the small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), although in recent years it has been shown that it does not contain enough phylogenetic information to robustly resolve global eukaryotic phylogeny. This has prompted the use of multi-gene analyses, especially in the form of long concatenations of numerous conserved protein sequences. However, this approach is severely limited by the small number of taxa for which such a large number of protein sequences is available today. We have explored the alternative approach of using only two markers but a large taxonomic sampling, by analysing a combination of SSU and large-subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences. This strategy allows also the incorporation of sequences from non-cultivated protists, e.g., Radiozoa (=radiolaria minus Phaeodarea). We provide the first LSU rRNA sequences for Heliozoa, Apusozoa (both Apusomonadida and Ancyromonadida), Cercozoa and Radiozoa. Our Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses for 91 eukaryotic combined SSU+LSU sequences yielded much stronger support than hitherto for the supergroup Rhizaria (Cercozoa plus Radiozoa plus Foraminifera) and several well-recognised groups and also for other problematic clades, such as the Retaria (Radiozoa plus Foraminifera) and, with more moderate support, the Excavata. Within opisthokonts, the combined tree strongly confirms that the filose amoebae Nuclearia are sisters to Fungi whereas other Choanozoa are sisters to animals. The position of some bikont taxa, notably Heliozoa and Apusozoa, remains unresolved. However, our combined trees suggest a more deeply diverging position for Ancyromonas, and perhaps also Apusomonas, than for other bikonts, suggesting that apusozoan zooflagellates may be central for understanding the early evolution of this huge eukaryotic group. Multiple protein sequences will be needed fully to resolve basal bikont phylogeny. Nonetheless, our results suggest that combined SSU+LSU rDNA phylogenies can help to resolve several ambiguous regions of the eukaryotic tree and identify key taxa for subsequent multi-gene analyses.},

  abstract = {Species tree inference from gene family trees is becoming increasingly popular because it can account for discordance between the species tree and the corresponding gene family trees. In particular, methods that can account for multiple-copy gene families exhibit potential to leverage paralogy as informative signal. At present, there does not exist any widely adopted inference method for this purpose. Here, we present SpeciesRax, the first maximum likelihood method that can infer a rooted species tree from a set of gene family trees and can account for gene duplication, loss, and transfer events. By explicitly modelling events by which gene trees can depart from the species tree, SpeciesRax leverages the phylogenetic rooting signal in gene trees. SpeciesRax infers species tree branch lengths in units of expected substitutions per site and branch support values via paralogy-aware quartets extracted from the gene family trees. Using both empirical and simulated datasets we show that SpeciesRax is at least as accurate as the best competing methods while being one order of magnitude faster on large datasets at the same time. We used SpeciesRax to infer a biologically plausible rooted phylogeny of the vertebrates comprising 188 species from 31612 gene families in one hour using 40 cores. SpeciesRax is available under GNU GPL at https://github.com/BenoitMorel/GeneRax and on BioConda.},

  abstract = {Premise of the study: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are globally important root symbioses that enhance plant growth and nutrition and influence ecosystem structure and function. To better characterize levels of AMF diversity relevant to ecosystem function, deeper sequencing depth in environmental samples is needed. In this study, Illumina barcoded primers and a bioinformatics pipeline were developed and applied to study AMF diversity and community structure in environmental samples. Methods: Libraries of small subunit ribosomal RNA fragment amplicons were amplified from environmental DNA using a single-step PCR reaction with barcoded NS31/AML2 primers. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer using version 2, 2 {\texttimes} 250-bp paired-end chemistry, and analyzed using QIIME and RDP Classifier. Results: Sequencing captured 196 to 6416 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; depending on clustering parameters) representing nine AMF genera. Regardless of clustering parameters, {$\sim$}20 OTUs dominated AMF communities (78--87\% reads) with the remaining reads distributed among other OTUs. Analyses also showed significant biogeographic differences in AMF communities and that community composition could be linked to specific edaphic factors. Discussion: Barcoded NS31/AML2 primers and Illumina MiSeq sequencing provide a powerful approach to address AMF diversity and variations in fungal assemblages across host plants, ecosystems, and responses to environmental drivers including global change.},

  abstract = {Since the first plantation of Terfezia mycorrhizal plants was established in 1999 in Murcia (Spain), an increasing demand for this crop, not only in Spain but also in other countries, has prompted research into new strategies and aspects that will enable us to pass from the experimental scale to medium- to large-scale cultivation. As a consequence of this leap, a new photoautotrophic Helianthemum micropropagation system has been developed. This system reduces the time needed to obtain mycorrhizal plants to 3 months since fungal inoculation is carried out at the moment plants are transferred from in vitro to ex vitro conditions, so that plant acclimatization and mycorrhization occur at the same time.Among the factors that most influence desert truffle production are water availability (irrigation), weed management, planting season, soil characteristics, and the frame of plantation. Special attention is focused on the water availability factor in this chapter.We found a statistical correlation between rainfall during the autumn of one year and Terfezia claveryi truffle production the following year. This new and important finding will help prevent reduced desert truffle production after dry years by enabling us to adjust soil water potential to the plant physiological parameters necessary to keep the mycorrhizal symbiosis productive. Physiological and molecular studies on T. claveryi mycelium and its symbiosis with Helianthemum almeriense have been carried out, and an aquaporin gene from T. claveryi (TcAQP1) that increases both water and CO2 conductivity in biological membranes has been cloned. This aquaporin gene has a role in improving the drought-stress tolerance of the mycelium. TcAQP1 expression was seen to be regulated to some extent during root colonization by the mycelium, which demonstrates the importance of this membrane channel in mycorrhizal symbiosis and in mycelium organization for ascoma formation.Finally, particular management practices are recommended for maximizing desert truffle production in an orchard.},

The phylogenetic analysis showed that re-classification was required for 12 taxa originally misidentified under various names. The changes led to the use of 8 valid names for these 12 taxa, including two new forms: T. striatus f. subclypeatus and T. medius f. ochraceus; and a new combination: Termitomyces brunneopileatus according to their placement on various clades and subclades in the phylogenetic trees. Termitomyces letestui and T. medius were taxonomically revised. In addition,~~~ T. letestui collected from China is the first record from the Asian continent. This species was so far collected only in tropical Africa. Similarly, T. robustus is reported for the first time from Cameroon. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis confirms T. subumkowaan as a new species that was originally described only on the basis of morphological features. The combined phylogenetic analysis and morphological features reveal that different strains of the same taxon show sometimes large variations in macro- and micromorphological features, some very likely with links to genetic factors other than genes sequenced here, thereby justifying the new forms erected within these taxa in order to facilitate their identification.},

  abstract = {Arid shrublands are stressful environments, typified by alkaline soils low in organic matter, with biologically-limiting extremes in water availability, temperature, and UV radiation. The widely-spaced plants and interspace biological soil crusts in these regions provide soil nutrients in a localized fashion, creating a mosaic pattern of plant- or crust-associated microhabitats with distinct nutrient composition. With sporadic and limited rainfall, nutrients are primarily retained in the shallow surface soil, patterning biological activity. We examined soil bacterial and fungal community responses to simulated nitrogen (N) deposition in an arid Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa field experiment in southern Nevada, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes. To examine potential interactions among the N application, microhabitat and soil depth, we sampled soils associated with shrub canopies and interspace biological crusts at two soil depths (0--0.5 or 0--10 cm) across the N-amendment gradient (0, 7, and 15 kg ha-1 yr-1). We hypothesized that localized compositional differences in soil microbiota would constrain the impacts of N addition to a microhabitat distribution that would reflect highly localized geochemical conditions and microbial community composition. The richness and community composition of both bacterial and fungal communities differed significantly by microhabitat and with soil depth in each microhabitat. Only bacterial communities exhibited significant responses to the N addition. Community composition correlated with microhabitat and depth differences in soil geochemical features. Given the distinct roles of soil bacteria and fungi in major nutrient cycles, the resilience of fungi and sensitivity of bacteria to N amendments suggests that increased N input predicted for many arid ecosystems could shift nutrient cycling toward pathways driven primarily by fungal communities.},

No significant interactions between N and CO2 were observed, but individual effects of N and CO2 were found. Elevated CO2 resulted in changes in phylogenetic similarity, and a shift to phylogenetic clustering of AMF communities. N addition resulted in higher phylogenetic diversity and evenness, with no shifts in community composition and no significant signal for phylogenetic clustering. N addition resulted in an increase in both available N and the N:P ratio in N-amended plots, which suggests that changing patterns of nutrient limitation could have lead to altered species interactions. These findings suggest that elevated levels of N and CO2 altered patterns of AMF community assembly, with potential effects on ecosystem function.},

Higher-attine fungi form two clades, Clade-A fungi (Leucocoprinus gongylophorus, formerly Attamyces) previously thought to be cultivated only by leafcutter ants, and a sister clade, Clade-B fungi, previously thought to be cultivated only by Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex ants. Contradicting this traditional view, we find that (i) leafcutter ants are not specialized to cultivate only Clade-A fungi because some leafcutter species ranging across South America cultivate Clade-B fungi; (ii) Trachymyrmex ants are not specialized to cultivate only Clade-B fungi because some Trachymyrmex species cultivate Clade-A fungi and other Trachymyrmex species cultivate fungi known so far only from lower-attine ants; (iii) in some locations, single higher-attine ant species or closely related cryptic species cultivate both Clade-A and Clade-B fungi; and (iv) ant?fungus co-evolution among higher-attine mutualisms is therefore less specialized than previously thought. Sympatric leafcutter ants can be ecologically dominant when cultivating either Clade-A or Clade-B fungi, sustaining with either cultivar-type huge nests that command large foraging territories; conversely, sympatric Trachymyrmex ants cultivating either Clade-A or Clade-B fungi can be locally abundant without achieving the ecological dominance of leafcutter ants. Ecological dominance of leafcutter ants therefore does not depend primarily on specialized fungiculture of L. gongylophorus (Clade-A), but must derive from ant?fungus synergisms and unique ant adaptations.},

We planted Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings into soils that were either a homogenized mix of upper and lower depths or vertically stratified combinations mimicking natural field conditions. * We found that both species colonized the upper or lower soil depths in the absence of competition, suggesting that their distributions were not limited by abiotic edaphic factors. In competition within homogeneous soils, R.~vesiculosus completely excluded colonization by R.~vinicolor, but R.~vinicolor was able to persist when soils were stratified. The amount of colonization by R.~vinicolor in the stratified soils was also significantly correlated with the number of multilocus genotypes present. * Taken together, our findings suggest that the differential vertical distributions of R.~vinicolor and R.~vesiculosus in natural settings are probably attributable to competition rather than edaphic specialization, but that soil heterogeneity may play a key role in promoting EM fungal diversity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Massive genomic data sets from high-throughput sequencing allow for new insights into complex biological systems such as microbial communities. Analyses of their diversity and structure are typically preceded by clustering millions of 16S rRNA gene sequences into OTUs. Swarm introduced a new clustering strategy which addresses important conceptual and performance issues of the popular de novo clustering approach. However, some parts of the new strategy, e.g. the fastidious option for increased clustering quality, come with their own restrictions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present the new exact, alignment-based de novo clustering tool GeFaST, which implements a generalisation of Swarm's fastidious clustering. Our tool extends the fastidious option to arbitrary clustering thresholds and allows to adjust its greediness. GeFaST was evaluated on mock-community and natural data and achieved higher clustering quality and performance for small to medium clustering thresholds compared to Swarm and other de novo tools. Clustering with GeFaST was between 6 and 197 times as fast as with Swarm, while the latter required up to 38\% less memory for non-fastidious clustering but at least three times as much memory for fastidious clustering. CONCLUSIONS: GeFaST extends the scope of Swarm's clustering strategy by generalising its fastidious option, thereby allowing for gains in clustering quality, and by increasing its performance (especially in the fastidious case). Our evaluations showed that GeFaST has the potential to leverage the use of the (fastidious) clustering strategy for higher thresholds and on larger data sets.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the rapidly increasing number of reads produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has driven the demand for efficient implementations of sequence alignments in bioinformatics. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are not able to leverage the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs with close-to-peak performance. We present AnySeq/GPU---a sequence alignment library that augments the AnySeq 1 library with a novel approach for accelerating dynamic programming (DP) alignment on GPUs by minimizing memory accesses using warp shuffles and half-precision arithmetic. Our implementation is based on the AnyDSL compiler framework which allows for convenient zero-cost abstractions through guaranteed partial evaluation. We show that our approach achieves over 80\% of the peak performance on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs thereby outperforming the GPU-based alignment libraries Any-Seq 1, GASAL 2, ADEPT, and NVBIO by a factor of at least 3.6 while achieving a median speedup of 19.2X over these tools across different alignment scenarios and sequence lengths when running on the same hardware. This leads to throughputs of up to 1.7 TCUPS (tera cell updates per second) on an NVIDIA GV100, up to 3.3 TCUPS with half-precision arithmetic on a single NVIDIA A100, and up to 3.8 TCUPS on an AMD MI100.

  abstract = {Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of ``over classification'' is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. IDTAXA's classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online ( http://DECIPHER.codes ).},

  abstract = {The last decade brought a still growing experimental evidence of mobilome impact on host's gene expression. We systematically analysed genomic location of transposable elements (TEs) in 625 publicly available fungal genomes from the NCBI database in order to explore their potential roles in genome evolution and correlation with species' lifestyle. We found that non-autonomous TEs and remnant copies are evenly distributed across genomes. In consequence, they also massively overlap with regions annotated as genes, which suggests a great contribution of TE-derived sequences to host's coding genome. Younger and potentially active TEs cluster with one another away from genic regions. This non-randomness is a sign of either selection against insertion of TEs in gene proximity or target site preference among some types of TEs. Proteins encoded by genes with old transposable elements insertions have significantly less repeat and protein-protein interaction motifs but are richer in enzymatic domains. However, genes only proximal to TEs do not display any functional enrichment. Our findings show that adaptive cases of TE insertion remain a marginal phenomenon, and the overwhelming majority of TEs are evolving neutrally. Eventually, animal-related and pathogenic fungi have more TEs inserted into genes than fungi with other lifestyles. This is the first systematic, kingdom-wide study concerning mobile elements and their genomic neighbourhood. The obtained results should inspire further research concerning the roles TEs played in evolution and how they shape the life we know today.},

To solve sequence alignment with quality scores, we first consider a more general problem where the input is weighted sequences which are sequences with probabilities that characters occur in each position. We propose a meaningful measure of an alignment of two weighted sequences and show that an optimal alignment in this measure can be found by dynamic programming. Sequence alignment with quality scores can be solved as a special case of the weighted sequence alignment problem.},

They share a common ancestor with animals in the eukaryotic supergroup Opisthokonta and have a deeper common ancestry with plants, yet several phenotypes such as morphological, physiological, or nutritional traits make them unique among all living organisms. This article provides an overview of some of the most important fungal traits, how they evolve, and what major genes and gene families contribute to their development. The traits highlighted here represent just a sample of the characteristics that have evolved in fungi, including polarized multicellular growth, fruiting body development, dimorphism, secondary metabolism, wood decay, and mycorrhizae. However, a great deal of other important traits also underlie the evolution of the taxonomically and phenotypically hyperdiverse fungal kingdom, which could fill up a volume on its own. After reviewing the evolution of these six well-studied traits in fungi, we discuss how the recurrent evolution of phenotypic similarity, that is, convergent evolution in the broad sense, has shaped their phylogenetic distribution in extant species.},

  abstract = {In developed forests and secondary successional sites, host plants can readily access ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi because of the ubiquitous ECM mycelia and spores in soil, but this is not the case in some primary successional sites. In a volcanic desert on Mt Fuji, Japan, most of the area is non-mycorrhizal habitat and has poorly developed soil spore-banks. ECM habitat, i.e. pioneer willow shrubs and a small surrounding area containing ECM mycelia, are quite sparsely distributed, accounting for about 1 \% of the ground surface in total. Such unique conditions provide us an interesting opportunity to explore the magnitude and role of direct mycelial connections between plants, i.e. ECM networks, in the field. It is difficult to observe individual ECM mycelial spread in soil, but the distribution of sporocarps and ECM roots having the same genotype indicate the spread of a mycelium in soil. We applied microsatellite markers to genotype sporocarps and ECM tips, and found that genets of two pioneer Laccaria species were small in size (mostly {$<$}1 m) and ephemeral. In contrast, genets of Scleroderma included some long-lived large genets ({$>$}10 m). These results indicate that ECM networks could vary considerably in size and longevity, even in the same site and associated with the same host species. Field transplanting experiment revealed that current-year willow seedlings rarely formed ECM associations in most habitats of the desert and showed poor growth. ECM infection from spores did not significantly improve seedling growth, indicating a small isolated mycelium on a tiny seeding may not be enough to acquire sufficient nutrients from extremely nutrient poor scoria. In contrast, seedlings transplanted near the pre-established willow shrubs, where ECM networks are available, readily formed ECM associations and grew well. Moreover, artificially reproduced ECM networks in previously non-mycorrhizal habitats significantly improved the growth of connected seedlings in 10 of 11 ECM fungal species in this desert. Therefore, ECM networks appear to be mostly positive and could be critical to seedling establishment, at least in this primary successional setting. Some previously proposed mechanisms may be less relevant to the observed positive effect of ECM networks on seedling establishment. For example, plant-to-plant carbon transfer through ECM networks might work for seedlings in dark forest floor, but not in primary successional settings characterized by strong sun light. More relevant mechanisms should include rapid ECM colonization with low costs, larger absorbing surface area than a solitary mycelium, and nutrient translocation within a network from nutrient rich soil patches to most demanding parts, often seedlings.},

  abstract = {Although soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in delivering various ecosystem functions and services, we are only beginning to understand how microbial communities are shaped by various soil physical properties and environmental factors. In this study, we integrate metabarcoding of bacteria and fungi and soil physical measurements at 60 locations on a 15{\texttimes}15m grid in an agricultural field to: (1) characterize the spatial variation of microbial richness and diversity, and (2) identify the soil physical parameters that are most strongly correlated with them. The study field is located in Silstrup Denmark, extends over 1.69ha, and slopes 1--2{$^\circ$} to the north. Soil samples for 454-pyrosequencing were extracted by pushing 50-mL sterilized plastic vials into the soil. Bulk soil samples were used for the measurement of pH, organic carbon, and soil texture. Intact 100cm3 soil cores, collected in triplicate, were used for measuring the soil water characteristic curve. Across the field, bacterial richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial autocorrelations. Fungal number of OTUs was quite similar over the field and thus no spatial autocorrelation was observed for them. Fungal Shannon diversity slightly increased from south to north, with spatial autocorrelation for distances larger than 100m. The ratio of clay to organic carbon (n) was found to be the best predictor of bacterial richness and diversity indices. Neither organic carbon nor clay content was significantly correlated with fungal richness and diversity indices. For soil structural parameters, soil water retention in the pF range 5--6.8 (parameter B) was significantly correlated with both bacterial and fungal Shannon diversities. Amount of macropores ({$>$}30{$\mu$}m) and total porosity ({$\phi$}) were only significantly correlated with fungal Shannon diversity. These results suggest that variation in microbial communities is not random but strongly related with variations in organic carbon, clay content, and soil water characteristics at the field scale.},

Several programs have been developed for identifying RNAs, including specific tools tailored to a particular RNA family as well as more general ones designed to work for any family. Many of these tools utilize covariance models (CMs), statistical models of the conserved sequence, and structure of an RNA family. In this chapter, as an illustrative example, the Infernal software package and CMs from the Rfam database are used to identify RNAs in the genome of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, uncovering some additional RNAs not present in the genome's initial annotation. Analysis of the results and comparison with family-specific methods demonstrate some important strengths and weaknesses of this general approach.},

In total, 25 genera and 51 species of edible fungi were recorded in the study area of which 32 were cited during interview. The most represented genera are Cantharellus, Marasmius, Russula et Termitomyces. Three species are used in traditional medicine and seven were sold or exchanged as in the form of barter. Knowledge on fungal species is hold by a small group of people within each ethnical group. Results of this study only representing about 50\% of the indigenous knowledge of the ethnical groups studied lead to intensify fieldworks with those populations in order to conserve traditional knowledge on the Wild Edible Fungi (WEF) in the future.Conclusions et application of findings: The outcome of such works will be to produce a guide of WEF in the Republic of Congo. Such a document will contribute to a better understanding of the african mycoflora.Keywords: Bomassa, traditional knowledge, Non Woody Forest Products, macrofungi, Makao, Forests of Northern Congo, Barter},

  abstract = {Motivation: While phylogenetic analyses of datasets containing 1000--5000 sequences are challenging for existing methods, the estimation of substantially larger phylogenies poses a problem of much greater complexity and scale.Methods: We present DACTAL, a method for phylogeny estimation that produces trees from unaligned sequence datasets without ever needing to estimate an alignment on the entire dataset. DACTAL combines iteration with a novel divide-and-conquer approach, so that each iteration begins with a tree produced in the prior iteration, decomposes the taxon set into overlapping subsets, estimates trees on each subset, and then combines the smaller trees into a tree on the full taxon set using a new supertree method. We prove that DACTAL is guaranteed to produce the true tree under certain conditions. We compare DACTAL to SAT{\'e} and maximum likelihood trees on estimated alignments using simulated and real datasets with 1000--27 643 taxa.Results: Our studies show that on average DACTAL yields more accurate trees than the two-phase methods we studied on very large datasets that are difficult to align, and has approximately the same accuracy on the easier datasets. The comparison to SAT{\'e} shows that both have the same accuracy, but that DACTAL achieves this accuracy in a fraction of the time. Furthermore, DACTAL can analyze larger datasets than SAT{\'e}, including a dataset with almost 28 000 sequences.Availability: DACTAL source code and results of dataset analyses are available at www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/dactal.Contact:tandy@cs.utexas.edu},

Bacterial and algal members of the system were also tested. A standard laboratory liquid medium, a complex, semi-natural liquid medium, and a semi-natural solid medium were used to grow the microorganisms. Ergosterol contents of fungal mycelium ranged from 1.9-2.5 mg g\textsuperscript{-1} dry organic mass in the standard medium, and were 3.4-16.4 mg g\textsuperscript{-1} in the semi-natural liquid medium. For any single growth medium, ergosterol content of mycelium was less variable with mycelial age than has been previously found for glucosamine. For Leptosphaeria obiones, ergosterol content in solid medium was estimated to be similar to that in semi-natural liquid, but for Phaeosphaeria typharum, solid medium yielded much higher ({\texttimes} 5) ergosterol estimates, possibly due to underestimated mycelial mass. Partial mycelial autolysis led to low estimates of ergosterol content (1.1 mg g\textsuperscript{-1} dry organic). Bacteria had negligible ergosterol contents, but there was evidence that green-microalgal ergosterol content might not be negligible in some decomposition systems.},

The ascomycetous fungi that dominate cordgrass leaf decomposition processes under natural conditions exhibited a boosting ({$>$}2-fold) of living standing crop (ergosterol content) by misting at the 1 st week after tagging of senescent leaves, but afterwards, living-fungal standing crop on misted blades was equivalent to that on control blades, confirming prior evidence that Spartina fungi are well adapted to natural, irregular wetting. Misting also caused 2-fold sharper temporal declines than control in instantaneous rates of fungal production (ergosterol synthesis), 5-fold declines in density of sexual reproductive structures that were not shown by controls, and 2-fold higher rates of loss of plant organic mass. Extra nitrogen gave a long-term boost to living-fungal standing crop (about 2-fold at 12 weeks), which was also reflected in rates of fungal production at 4 weeks, suggesting that saltmarsh fungal production is nitrogen-limited. Although bacterial and green-microalgal crops were boosted by manipulations of nitrogen and/or water, their maximal crops remained {$\leq$}0.3 or 2\% (bacteria or green microalgae, respectively) of contemporaneous living-fungal crop. The fungal carbon-productivity values obtained, in conjunction with rates of loss of plant carbon, hinted that fungal yield can be high ({$>$}50\%), and that it is boosted by high availability of nitrogen. We speculate that one partial cause of high fungal yield could be subsidy of fungal growth by dissolved organic carbon from outside decomposing leaves.},

However, since transmembrane regions of a protein are in a distinctly different environment than globular proteins, one would expect generalized substitution matrices to be inappropriate for transmembrane regions. RESULTS: We present the PHAT (predicted hydrophobic and transmembrane) matrix, which significantly outperforms generalized matrices and a previously published transmembrane matrix in searches with transmembrane queries. We conclude that a better matrix can be constructed by using background frequencies characteristic of the twilight zone, where low-scoring true positives have scores indistinguishable from high-scoring false positives, rather than the amino acid frequencies of the database. The PHAT matrix may help improve the accuracy of sequence alignments and evolutionary trees of membrane proteins.},

However, accurate large-scale multiple sequence alignment is very difficult, especially when the dataset contains fragmentary sequences. We present UPP, a multiple sequence alignment method that uses a new machine learning technique, the ensemble of hidden Markov models, which we propose here. UPP produces highly accurate alignments for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences, even on ultra-large datasets or datasets containing fragmentary sequences.

  abstract = {Exploring the link between above- and belowground biodiversity has been a major theme of recent ecological research, due in large part to the increasingly well-recognized role that soil microorganisms play in driving plant community processes. In this study, we utilized a fieldbased tree experiment in Minnesota, USA to assess the effect of changes in plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity on the richness and composition of both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness was significantly positively influenced by increasing plant phylogenetic diversity, while saprotrophic fungal species richness was significantly affected by plant leaf nitrogen content, specific root length, and standing biomass. The increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal richness associated with increasing plant phylogenetic diversity was driven by the combined presence of ectomycorrhizal fungal specialists in plots with both gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Although the species composition of both the ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities changed significantly in response to changes in plant species composition, the effect was much greater for ectomycorrhizal fungi. In addition, ectomycorrhizal but not saprotrophic fungal species composition was significantly influenced by both plant phylum (angiosperm, gymnosperm, both) and origin (Europe, America, both). While the phylum effect was driven by differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, the origin effect was driven by differences in community heterogeneity. Taken together, this study emphasizes the guild-specific nature of plant-associated effects on soil fungal communities and provides a mechanistic basis for the positive link between plant phylogenetic diversity and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness.},

Fungal communities include quiescent taxa and the functionally important and metabolically active taxa that respond to changes in the environment. To determine fungal community shifts along a tree species diversity gradient, needles of Norway spruce were sampled from trees from four mature European forests. We hypothesized that the fungal communities and specific fungal taxa would correlate with tree species diversity. Furthermore, the active fungal community, and not the total community, would shift along the tree diversity gradient. High-throughput sequencing showed significant differences in the fungal communities in the different forests, and in one forest, tree diversity effects were observed, though this was not a general phenomenon. Our study also suggests that studying the metabolically active community may not provide additional information about community composition or diversity.},

  abstract = {Summary RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism conserved in eukaryotes that represses gene expression by means of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) of about 20 to 30 nucleotides (nt). Before the identification of the RNAi mechanism, its effects were observed in different organisms and described as independent processes. These effects were first observed in plants, in which the introduction of sequences intended to increase the production of floral pigments had the opposite effects, resulting in albino transformants. Hence, this phenomenon was called cosuppression (1 , 2). The same phenomenon was also observed in the fungus Neurospora crassa, in which an albino phenotype was obtained after transformation with extra copies of the gene al-1, which is involved in the production of carotenoids (3). The characterization of this phenomenon revealed reversibility of the albino phenotype, since some descendants of the original albino transformants reverted to the wild type phenotype. At that time, this phenomenon was not linked to the process of cosuppression observed in plants and was named ``quelling.'' The discovery of quelling in N. crassa represented a milestone in the field of RNAi, because this fungal model allowed the use of classic genetic tools to unravel the machinery of RNAi. The molecular mechanism of RNAi was finally uncovered by Fire et al., who discovered the central role of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the RNAi of Caenorhabditis elegans (4). This central role of dsRNA was soon established in all the organisms harboring a functional RNAi mechanism, including plants, fungi, and animals. Cosuppression, quelling, and other posttranscriptional gene-silencing-related phenomena were integrated into the same conserved mechanism of RNA interference (5).},

  abstract = {In the semi-arid zone of West Africa, the growth of annual crops is severely constrained by soil and climatic conditions. Soil physical properties, specifically low porosity resulting from the particle-size distribution and predominantly low-activity clay, restricts root system development and crop growth. Using intensive mechanical tillage is an effective method in enhancing soil porosity and physical properties. This paper summarizes the results of tillage experiments conducted for about 30 years in West Africa. Tillage methods evaluated involved deep plowing with motorized equipment or animal powered tools using tined equipment and ridgers for earthing up. Soil properties and plant characteristics evaluated were porosity, root development, microbial life, soil-water reserves, and crop yields. Results of no-tillage and minimum-tillage studies are also discussed. Application of reduced tillage techniques did not produce satisfactory results. Several mulch farming systems, using dead or living vegetative covers, were also tested in regions where annual rainfall exceeds 1000 mm. The results obtained support the conclusion that soil tillage is an excellent means of improving soil physical properties and crop yields in the semi-arid regions of West Africa. However, adaptation of this technique by resource-poor small farmers poses several technical and logistical problems.},

  abstract = {During the last few years, DNA sequence analysis has become one of the primary means of taxonomic identification of species, particularly so for species that are minute or otherwise lack distinct, readily obtainable morphological characters. Although the number of sequences available for comparison in public databases such as GenBank increases exponentially, only a minuscule fraction of all organisms have been sequenced, leaving taxon sampling a momentous problem for sequence-based taxonomic identification. When querying GenBank with a set of unidentified sequences, a considerable proportion typically lack fully identified matches, forming an ever-mounting pile of sequences that the researcher will have to monitor manually in the hope that new, clarifying sequences have been submitted by other researchers. To alleviate these concerns, a project to automatically monitor select unidentified sequences in GenBank for taxonomic progress through repeated local BLAST searches was initiated. Mycorrhizal fungi -- a field where species identification often is prohibitively complex -- and the much used ITS locus were chosen as test bed. A Perl script package called emerencia is presented. On a regular basis, it downloads select sequences from GenBank, separates the identified sequences from those insufficiently identified, and performs BLAST searches between these two datasets, storing all results in an SQL database. On the accompanying web-service http://emerencia.math.chalmers.se , users can monitor the taxonomic progress of insufficiently identified sequences over time, either through active searches or by signing up for e-mail notification upon disclosure of better matches. Other search categories, such as listing all insufficiently identified sequences (and their present best fully identified matches) publication-wise, are also available. The ever-increasing use of DNA sequences for identification purposes largely falls back on the assumption that public sequence databases contain a thorough sampling of taxonomically well-annotated sequences. Taxonomy, held by some to be an old-fashioned trade, has accordingly never been more important. emerencia does not automate the taxonomic process, but it does allow researchers to focus their efforts elsewhere than countless manual BLAST runs and arduous sieving of BLAST hit lists. The emerencia system is available on an open source basis for local installation with any organism and gene group as targets.},

Such approaches, popularly known as barcoding, are underpinned by the assumption that the reference databases used for comparison are sufficiently complete and feature correctly and informatively annotated entries. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study uses a large set of fungal DNA sequences from the inclusive International Nucleotide Sequence Database to show that the taxon sampling of fungi is far from complete, that about 20\% of the entries may be incorrectly identified to species level, and that the majority of entries lack descriptive and up-to-date annotations. Conclusions The problems with taxonomic reliability and insufficient annotations in public DNA repositories form a tangible obstacle to sequence-based species identification, and it is manifest that the greatest challenges to biological barcoding will be of taxonomical, rather than technical, nature.},

The region is known to show certain variability even within species, although its intraspecific variability is often held to be limited and clearly separated from interspecific variability. The existence of such a divide between intra- and interspecific variability is implicitly assumed by automated approaches to species identification, but whether intraspecific variability indeed is negligible within the fungal kingdom remains contentious. The present study estimates the intraspecific ITS variability in all fungi presently available to the mycological community through the international sequence databases. Substantial differences were found within the kingdom, and the results are not easily correlated to the taxonomic affiliation or nutritional mode of the taxa considered. No single unifying yet stringent upper limit for intraspecific variability, such as the canonical 3\% threshold, appears to be applicable with the desired outcome throughout the fungi. Our results caution against simplified approaches to automated ITS-based species delimitation and reiterate the need for taxonomic expertise in the translation of sequence data into species names.},

A non-trivial proportion of the public fungal DNA sequences are, however, compromised in terms of quality and reliability, contributing noise and bias to sequence-borne inferences such as phylogenetic analysis, diversity assessment, and barcoding. In this paper we discuss various aspects and pitfalls of sequence quality assessment. Based on our observations, we provide a set of guidelines to assist in manual quality management of newly generated, near-full-length (Sanger-derived) fungal ITS sequences and to some extent also sequences of shorter read lengths, other genes or markers, and groups of organisms. The guidelines are intentionally non-technical and do not require substantial bioinformatics skills or significant computational power. Despite their simple nature, we feel they would have caught the vast majority of the severely compromised ITS sequences in the public corpus. Our guidelines are nevertheless not infallible, and common sense and intuition remain important elements in the pursuit of compromised sequence data. The guidelines focus on basic sequence authenticity and reliability of the newly generated sequences, and the user may want to consider additional resources and steps to accomplish the best possible quality control. A discussion on the technical resources for further sequence quality management is therefore provided in the supplementary material.},

  abstract = {Abstract A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches has been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.},

  abstract = {Codon reassignments have been reported across all domains of life. With the increasing number of sequenced genomes, the development of systematic approaches for genetic code detection is essential for accurate downstream analyses. Three automated prediction tools exist so far: FACIL, GenDecoder and Bagheera; the last two respectively restricted to metazoan mitochondrial genomes and CUG reassignments in yeast nuclear genomes. These tools can only analyze a single genome at a time and are often not followed by a validation procedure, resulting in a high rate of false positives.We present CoreTracker, a new algorithm for the inference of sense-to-sense codon reassignments. CoreTracker identifies potential codon reassignments in a set of related genomes, then uses statistical evaluations and a random forest classifier to predict those that are the most likely to be correct. Predicted reassignments are then validated through a phylogeny-aware step that evaluates the impact of the new genetic code on the protein alignment. Handling simultaneously a set of genomes in a phylogenetic framework, allows tracing back the evolution of each reassignment, which provides information on its underlying mechanism. Applied to metazoan and yeast genomes, CoreTracker significantly outperforms existing methods on both precision and sensitivity.CoreTracker is written in Python and available at https://github.com/UdeM-LBIT/CoreTracker.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The most commonly used methods fix a single multiple alignment and consider only substitutions as phylogenetically informative mutations, though alignments and phylogenies should be inferred jointly as insertions and deletions also carry informative signals. Methods addressing these issues have been developed only recently and there has not been so far a user-friendly program with a graphical interface that implements these methods.Results: We have developed an extendable software package in the Java programming language that samples from the joint posterior distribution of phylogenies, alignments and evolutionary parameters by applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The package also offers tools for efficient on-the-fly summarization of the results. It has a graphical interface to configure, start and supervise the analysis, to track the status of the Markov chain and to save the results. The background model for insertions and deletions can be combined with any substitution model. It is easy to add new substitution models to the software package as plugins. The samples from the Markov chain can be summarized in several ways, and new postprocessing plugins may also be installed.Availability: The code is available from http://phylogeny-cafe.elte.hu/StatAlign/Contact:miklosi@ramet.elte.hu},

Currently, the ability of ECM fungi to metabolize this nitrate is poorly understood. {$\bullet$} Here, growth was examined among 106 isolates, representing 68 species, of ECM fungi on nitrate as the sole N source. In addition, the occurrence of genes coding for the nitrate reductase enzyme (nar gene) in a broad range of ectomycorrhizal fungi was investigated. {$\bullet$} All isolates grew on nitrate, but there was a strong taxonomic signature in the biomass production, with the Russulaceae and Amanita showing the lowest growth. Thirty-five partial nar sequences were obtained from 43 tested strains comprising 31 species and 10 genera. These taxa represent three out of the four clades of the Agaricales within which ECM fungi occur. No nar sequences were recovered from the Russulaceae and Amanita, but Southern hybridization showed that the genes were present. {$\bullet$} The results demonstrate that the ability to utilize nitrate as an N source is widespread in ECM fungi, even in those fungi from boreal forests where the supply of nitrate may be very low.},

  abstract = {The fungus Cenococcum geophilum Fr. (Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota) is one of the most common ectomycorrhizal fungi in boreal to temperate regions. A series of molecular studies has demonstrated that C. geophilum is monophyletic but a heterogeneous species or a species complex. Here, we revisit the phylogenetic diversity of C. geophilum sensu lato from a regional to intercontinental scale by using new data from Florida (USA) along with existing data in GenBank from Japan, Europe, and North America. The combination of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene resolved six well-supported lineages (87--100 \% bootstrap values) that are closely related to each other and a seventh lineage that is phylogenetically distinct. A multi-locus analysis (small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), translational elongation factor (TEF), and the largest and second-largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2)) revealed that the divergent lineage is the sister group to all other known Cenococcum isolates. Isolates of the divergent lineage grow fast on nutrient media and do not form ectomycorrhizas on seedlings of several pine and oak species. Our results indicate that C. geophilum sensu lato includes more phylogenetically distinct cryptic species than have previously been reported. Furthermore, the divergent lineage appears to be a non-mycorrhizal sister group. We discuss the phylogenetic diversity of C. geophilum sensu lato and argue in favor of species recognition based on phylogenetic and ecological information in addition to morphological characteristics. A new genus and species (Pseudocenococcum floridanum gen. et sp. nov.) is proposed to accommodate a divergent and putatively non-mycorrhizal lineage.},

The intention of this study was to find out whether the high molecular diversity in Sebacinales can be verified by micromorphological characteristics. Therefore, we carried out molecular and morphological studies on all generic type species of Sebacinales and additional representative taxa. Our results encouraged us to disentangle some phylogenetic and taxonomic discrepancies and to improve sebacinalean classifications. This comprises generic circumscriptions and affiliations, as well as higher taxon groupings. At the family level, we redefined the Sebacinaceae, formerly the Sebacinales group A, and set it apart from the Sebacinales group B. For taxonomical purposes, it seems appropriate to refer Paulisebacina, Craterocolla, Chaetospermum, Globulisebacina, Tremelloscypha, and Sebacina to the Sebacinaceae and Piriformospora, and Serendipita to the Sebacinales group B. At the lower taxonomic level, we propose within the Sebacinaceae (1) to introduce Paulisebacina for Sebacina allantoidea, (2) to transfer Efibulobasidium rolleyi into a new monotypic genus, Globulisebacina, (3) to include Tremellostereum in Tremelloscypha, (4) to transfer Sebacina amesii into Tremelloscypha, (5) to combine S. helvelloides and S. concrescens in their own genus, Helvellosebacina, (6) to transfer Tremellodendron spp. into Sebacina, (7) to define S. epigaea s.str. without cystidia and flagelliform dikaryophyses, but with star-shaped resting spores, and (8) to separate S. cystidiata with simultaneously irregular germinating spores and inconspicuous cystidia, and S. flagelliformis with flagelliform dikaryophyses from S. epigaea s.str.

  abstract = {Fungi are an important and diverse component of soil communities, but these communities have proven difficult to study in conventional biotic surveys. We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA genes by PCR and high-throughput sequencing of cloned fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal ITS sequences, as well as 112 ITS sequences from other eukaryotic microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota sequences were present in both the ITS and small-subunit libraries, while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal, plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863 fungal ITS sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Isolated wetlands are often degraded by agriculture, increasing sediment accretion and altering plant composition. Two common opposing wetland restoration practices are self-design vs. intensive revegetation. Self-design restores hydrogeomorphology without inoculating wetland taxa into restoration sites. Self-design may not meet restoration targets if dispersal-limited plants do not colonize restoration sites. Alternatively, intensive revegetation (hydrogeomorphic restoration combined with revegetation) is costly and time consuming. We investigated plant dispersal-limitation in 309 isolated wetlands among two agricultural landscapes in the U.S. Great Plains (the western High Plains (WHP) and the Rainwater Basin (RWB)) and three land-uses (reference, croplands, and previous croplands) to predict optimal restoration practices. We present analytical tools predicting whether self-design or intensive revegetation will be more successful elsewhere. In the WHP and RWB, perennial wetland cover was 61\% and 31\% greater in reference than in other land-uses. Distance to the nearest reference wetland explained perennial wetland richness in both regions, and area of reference wetlands within 15 km also was important in the WHP. Annual wetland species were over-represented in previous cropland wetlands and were less influenced by landscape isolation. We analytically identified dispersal-limited and cosmopolitan species in reference wetlands, with distance to reference wetlands and area of surrounding reference wetlands important in determining composition. Further, dispersal-limited plants in reference wetlands had greater cover in clustered than isolated wetlands in previous croplands. Plant community patterns in reference conditions may predict composition in restored wetlands. This aids selection of self-design or revegetation restoration approaches for individual plant species in isolated wetlands.},

Analyses of both a partial sequence of the ITS region of nuclear DNA and a partial sequence of the {$\beta$}-tubulin gene were able to resolve specimens of each species. Analyses revealed a greater divergence of the {$\beta$}-tubulin region than the ITS region. Based on molecular phylogeny of the combination of the ITS and {$\beta$}-tubulin regions, A. muscaria could be separated into at least three groups (Eurasian, Eurasian subalpine, and North American), and A. pantherina could be separated into at least two groups (North American and Eurasian). We hypothesize that the speciation of A. muscaria occurred in Eurasia with subsequent migration to North America via land bridges. However, it is impossible to determine whether A. pantherina moved from Eurasia to North America or vice versa. For both A. muscaria and A. pantherina the intracontinental relationships of both Eurasia and North America were closer than the relationships between eastern Asia and eastern North America.},

  abstract = {Fungal-bacterial interactions play a key role in the functioning of many ecosystems. Thus, understanding their interactive dynamics is of central importance for gaining predictive knowledge on ecosystem functioning. However, it is challenging to disentangle the mechanisms behind species associations from observed co-occurrence patterns, and little is known about the directionality of such interactions. Here, we applied joint species distribution modeling to high-throughput sequencing data on co-occurring fungal and bacterial communities in deadwood to ask whether fungal and bacterial co-occurrences result from shared habitat use (i.e., deadwood's properties) or whether there are fungal-bacterial interactive associations after habitat characteristics are taken into account. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the interactions are mainly modulated through fungal communities influencing bacterial communities. For that, we quantified how much the predictive power of the joint species distribution models for bacterial and fungal community improved when accounting for the other community. Our results show that fungi and bacteria form tight association networks (i.e., some species pairs co-occur more frequently and other species pairs co-occur less frequently than expected by chance) in deadwood that include common (or opposite) responses to the environment as well as (potentially) biotic interactions. Additionally, we show that information about the fungal occurrences and abundances increased the power to predict the bacterial abundances substantially, whereas information about the bacterial occurrences and abundances increased the power to predict the fungal abundances much less. Our results suggest that fungal communities may mainly affect bacteria in deadwood. IMPORTANCE Understanding the interactive dynamics between fungal and bacterial communities is important to gain predictive knowledge on ecosystem functioning. However, little is known about the mechanisms behind fungal-bacterial associations and the directionality of species interactions. Applying joint species distribution modeling to high-throughput sequencing data on co-occurring fungal-bacterial communities in deadwood, we found evidence that nonrandom fungal-bacterial associations derive from shared habitat use as well as (potentially) biotic interactions. Importantly, the combination of cross-validations and conditional cross-validations helped us to answer the question about the directionality of the biotic interactions, providing evidence that suggests that fungal communities may mainly affect bacteria in deadwood. Our modeling approach may help gain insight into the directionality of interactions between different components of the microbiome in other environments.},

Field-sampled fresh ectomycorrhizal root tips of C.~anzutake on various hosts such as pines, spruce, and oaks were vortexed with 0.005\% Tween 80 solution, surface sterilized with 1\% calcium hypochlorite solution, rinsed with sterilized distilled water, and placed on modified Norkrans' C (MNC) agar plate medium. Most ectomycorrhizal root tips of C.~anzutake produced yellowish mycelial colonies within a few months. In contrast, tissue isolation from basidiomata provided limited cultures of C.~anzutake but much contamination of bacteria and molds, even on media that contained antibiotics. The established C.~anzutake cultures had clamp connections on the hyphae and contained intracellular oily droplets. These cultured isolates were identified as C.~anzutake by sequence analysis of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and translation elongation factor EF1-alpha (tef-1) genes.},

  abstract = {The `two-layer' and `pulse-reserve' hypotheses were developed 30 years ago and continue to serve as the standard for many experiments and modeling studies that examine relationships between primary productivity and rainfall variability in aridlands. The two-layer hypothesis considers two important plant functional types (FTs) and predicts that woody and herbaceous plants are able to co-exist in savannas because they utilize water from different soil layers (or depths). The pulse-reserve model addresses the response of individual plants to precipitation and predicts that there are `biologically important' rain events that stimulate plant growth and reproduction. These pulses of precipitation may play a key role in long-term plant function and survival (as compared to seasonal or annual rainfall totals as per the two-layer model). In this paper, we re-evaluate these paradigms in terms of their generality, strengths, and limitations. We suggest that while seasonality and resource partitioning (key to the two-layer model) and biologically important precipitation events (key to the pulse-reserve model) are critical to understanding plant responses to precipitation in aridlands, both paradigms have significant limitations. Neither account for plasticity in rooting habits of woody plants, potential delayed responses of plants to rainfall, explicit precipitation thresholds, or vagaries in plant phenology. To address these limitations, we integrate the ideas of precipitation thresholds and plant delays, resource partitioning, and plant FT strategies into a simple `threshold-delay' model. The model contains six basic parameters that capture the nonlinear nature of plant responses to pulse precipitation. We review the literature within the context of our threshold-delay model to: (i) develop testable hypotheses about how different plant FTs respond to pulses; (ii) identify weaknesses in the current state-of-knowledge; and (iii) suggest future research directions that will provide insight into how the timing, frequency, and magnitude of rainfall in deserts affect plants, plant communities, and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Orchid mycorrhizal (OrM) fungi play a crucial role in the ontogeny of orchids, yet little is known about how the structure of OrM fungal communities varies with space and environmental factors. Previous studies suggest that within orchid patches, the distance to adult orchids may affect the abundance of OrM fungi. Many orchid species grow in species-rich temperate semi-natural grasslands, the persistence of which depends on moderate physical disturbances, such as grazing and mowing. The aim of this study was to test whether the diversity, structure and composition of OrM fungal community are influenced by the orchid patches and management intensity in semi-natural grasslands. We detected putative OrM fungi from 0 to 32 m away from the patches of host orchid species (Orchis militaris and Platanthera chlorantha) in 21 semi-natural calcareous grasslands using pyrosequencing. In addition, we assessed different ecological conditions in semi-natural grasslands but primarily focused on the effect of grazing intensity on OrM fungal communities in soil. We found that investigated orchid species were mostly associated with Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae and, to a lesser extent, with Sebacinales. Of all the examined factors, the intensity of grazing explained the largest proportion of variation in OrM fungal as well as total fungal community composition in soil. Spatial analyses showed limited evidence for spatial clustering of OrM fungi and their dependence on host orchids. Our results indicate that habitat management can shape OrM fungal communities, and the spatial distribution of these fungi appears to be weakly structured outside the orchid patches.},

  abstract = {Resolving species delimitation issues of European Cantharellus is crucial to correctly name chanterelles around the globe. Thirty names referring to Cantharellus s. str. have been described in Europe, some of which are used in other continents. Based on combined analyses of ITS2, LSU, RPB2 and TEF-1, merely eight species are here recognized in Europe applying the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition criteria, one of which, C. roseofagetorum, is described as new. Morphological characters used in species delimitation are mapped and their variability evaluated. The colour of the hymenophore in young specimens is found to be a rather constant morphological character of taxonomic use. European species of Cantharellus are morphologically distinguished by unique combinations of characters, such as the presence of a pink pileal coating, pileus and hymenophore colour when young, and in some cases, the mean spore length and ecology. Eighteen type specimens from Europe are sequenced. Based on revised species concepts sixteen novel taxonomic synonyms are here proposed for European chanterelles: C. alborufescens (= C. henrici, C. ilicis, C. lilacinopruinatus), C. amethysteus (= C. cibarius subsp. squamulosus, C. cibarius var. umbrinus, C. rufipes), C. cibarius (= C. cibarius var. atlanticus, C. parviluteus), C. ferruginascens (= C. cibarius var. flavipes), C. friesii (= C. ignescens), C. pallens (= C. cibarius var. albidus, C. cibarius var. bicolor, C. subpruinosus), and C. romagnesianus (= C. pseudominimus, C. lourizanianus, C. romagnesianus var. parvisporus). The type of Cantharellus, C. cibarius, is epitypified. Descriptions, colour illustrations and a key to all European species are provided.},

  abstract = {Wood-inhabiting fungi are one of the most important groups of organisms as they contribute substantially to carbon and nutrient cycles by decomposing dead wood. Current knowledge of their occurrence, distribution, and drivers of their diversity derives almost exclusively from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. We sampled wood-inhabiting fungi across Benin, a tropical country in West Africa with a strong north--south seasonality gradient consisting of three macroclimatic zones. We aimed at determining whether macroclimate or the resource (size or amount of dead wood, number of host tree species, and stage of wood decomposition) is more important for their diversity. Variation partitioning revealed a stronger partial effect of resource on fungal species richness and a strong effect of macroclimate on the community composition. A more detailed linear mixed-effects model revealed a significantly positive effect of host richness, amount of dead wood, and macroclimate on fungal species richness and a significantly positive effect of macroclimate and stage of wood decomposition on the community composition. These findings are consistent with patterns found in temperate and boreal ecosystems, which indicates the existence of general pattern of the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi. Based on these results, we recommend that existing knowledge should be exploited for the conservation of wood-inhabiting fungi in tropical Africa. Thus, to protect tropical wood-inhabiting fungal diversity, we recommend that any size of dead-wood objects of diverse tree species be enriched in all tropical macroclimatic zones.},

The progression of processes in such systems usually involves check-points and events at which the relationships between the components are altered in response to stimuli. Detecting these events together with the implicated components can help understand the temporal aspects of complex biological systems. Here we propose a regularized regression-based approach for identifying breakpoints and corresponding segments from multivariate time-series data. In combination with techniques from clustering, the approach also allows estimating the significance of the determined breakpoints as well as the key components implicated in the emergence of the breakpoints. Comparative analysis with the existing alternatives demonstrates the power of the approach to identify biologically meaningful breakpoints in diverse time-resolved transcriptomics data sets from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.},

Collected fungi were described in fresh state and dried exsiccates examined for microscopic description before morpho-anatomical identification. ECM fungi abundantly fruited exclusively in mixed caesalp, monodominant Gilbertiodendron and Uapaca forest clumps, independently of elevation, rainfall, topography and soil texture. 21 ECM tree species in 11 genera belonging to two families, Ceasalpiniaceae and Phyllanthaceae, dominated ECM forest clumps. More than 100 putative ECM fungal species in 27 genera were identified and assigned to seven families and one super family group. Members of Russulaceae and Amanitaceae recruited the highest number of ECM taxa, followed by species of Boletoids and Cantharellaceae. Paxillus, Clavulina, Coltricia, Scleroderma, Cortinarius and Inocybe genera contained limited species. 12 ECM fungal species were locally edible, including Lactarius gymnocarpus and all chanterelles. Though, species richness was very large in a mountainous area, all four sites shared a substantial large number of ECM mushroom species. Low plant diversity but high fungal richness recommends ECM forest clumps for biodiversity sanctuaries.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Morphology of organisms is an important source of evidence for biodiversity assessment, taxonomic decisions, and understanding of evolution. Shape information about zoological and botanical objects is often treated quantitatively and in this form improves species identification. In studies of fungi, quantitative shape analysis was almost ignored. The disseminated propagules of fungi, the spores, are crucial for their taxonomy -- currently in the form of linear measurements or subjectively defined shape categories. It remains unclear how much quantifying spore shape information can improve species identification. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that shape, as a richer source of information, overperforms size when performing automated identification of fungal species. We used the fungi of the genus \emph{ Subulicystidium } (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) as a study object. We analysed 2D spore shape data via elliptic Fourier and Principal Component analyses. With flexible discriminant analysis, we achieved a slightly higher species identification success rate for shape predictors (61.5\%) than for size predictors (59.1\%). However, we achieved the highest rate for a combination of both (64.7\%). We conclude that quantifying fungal spore shapes is worth the effort. We provide an open access protocol which, we hope, will stimulate a broader use of quantitative shape analysis in fungal taxonomy. We also discuss the challenges of such analyses that are specific to fungal spores.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Morphology of organisms is an essential source of evidence for taxonomic decisions and understanding of ecology and evolutionary history. The geometric structure (i.e., numeric description of shape) provides richer and mathematically different information about an organism's morphology than linear measurements. A little is known on how these two sources of morphological information (shape vs. size) contribute to the identification of organisms when implied simultaneously. This study hypothesized that combining geometric information on the outline with linear measurements results in better species identification than either evidence alone can provide. As a test system for our research, we used the microscopic spores of fungi from the genus Subulicystidium (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota). We analyzed 2D spore shape data via elliptic Fourier and principal component analyses. Using flexible discriminant analysis, we achieved the highest species identification success rate for a combination of shape and size descriptors (64.7\%). The shape descriptors alone predicted species slightly better than size descriptors (61.5\% vs. 59.1\%). We conclude that adding geometric information on the outline to linear measurements improves the identification of the organisms. Despite the high relevance of spore traits for the taxonomy of fungi, they were previously rarely analyzed with the tools of geometric morphometrics. Therefore, we supplement our study with an open access protocol for digitizing and summarizing fungal spores' shape and size information. We propagate a broader use of geometric morphometric analysis for microscopic propagules of fungi and other organisms.},

  abstract = {Truffles, as hypogeous, ectomycorrhizal fungi, have no means to actively discharge spores into the environment and thus depend on mycophagists for spore dispersal. After consumption of fruiting bodies by animals and passage through the digestive tract, the spores are released in faecal pellets. Recently, in the Abruzzo region (Italy), Hystrix cristata has been spotted inside private truffi{\`e}res, but its role in spore dispersal has never been investigated. Here, we report our research on the occurrence of Tuber aestivum spores in porcupine's faecal contents in a truffi{\`e}re in L'Aquila, Italy, where a H. cristata specimen was photographed. The spores were isolated from faeces by using a suspension of 0.7 M ZnSO4. We also verified degradation and disfiguration of the digested spores' reticular ornamentation compared to that of fresh spores from ascomata collected inside the truffi{\`e}re, through measurements performed by scanning electron microscopy. A few truffle spores had germinated within the faeces.},

Doi with morphological and molecular techniques. These two species were identical in both macro- and micromorphological characters and were clearly different from the generally known O. asterosperma. The identity of the two species and their distinctness from O. asterosperma was further supported by both nuclear large subunit and ITS rDNA phylogeny. The molecular analyses also revealed that O. columellifera shares its lineage with the boletoid mushroom-forming Xerocomus chrysenteron complex and that it does not form a monophyletic clade with other Octaviania species. Our morphological reevaluation, including transmission electron microscopic observation of basidiospores, clarified the taxonomic boundary between O. columellifera and other Japanese Octaviania species. Accordingly we propose a new genus, Heliogaster, for O. columellifera with designation of the lectotype. We discuss phylogenetic relationships with Octaviania sensu stricto species and the closely related boletoid (pileate-stipitate) fungi, generic characters of Heliogaster and intraspecific phylogeny.},

  abstract = {The sequestrate (truffle-like) basidiomycete genera Rossbeevera, Chamonixia, and Octaviania are closely related to the epigeous mushroom genera Leccinum and Leccinellum. In order to elucidate the properties and placement of several undescribed sequestrate taxa in the group and to reveal the evolutionary history of Rossbeevera and its allies, we conducted phylogenetic analyses based on three nuclear (ITS, nLSU, EF-1{$\alpha$}) and two mitochondrial DNA loci (ATP6 and mtSSU) as well as precise morphological observations. Phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear loci suggest a complex evolutionary history with sequestrate fruiting bodies present in several clades, including a previously unrecognized sister clade to Rossbeevera. Here we propose a new sequestrate genus, Turmalinea, with four new species and one new subspecies as well as two new species of Rossbeevera. The three-locus nuclear phylogeny resolves species-level divergence within the Rossbeevera-Turmalinea lineage, whereas a separate phylogeny based on two mitochondrial genes corresponds to geographic distance within each species-level lineage and suggests incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene introgression within several intraspecific lineages of Rossbeevera. Furthermore, topological incongruence among the three nuclear single-locus phylogenies suggests that ancient speciation within Rossbeevera probably involved considerable ILS. We also found an unusually long, minisatellite-like insertion within the ITS2 in all Rossbeevera and Turmalinea species. A barcode gap analysis demonstrates that the insertion is more informative for discrimination at various taxonomic levels than the rest of the ITS region and could therefore serve as a unique molecular barcode for these genera.},

  abstract = {Birds show tremendous ecological disparity in spite of strong biomechanical constraints imposed by flight. Modular skeletal evolution is generally accepted to have facilitated this, with distinct body regions showing semi-independent evolutionary trajectories. However, this hypothesis has received little scrutiny. We analyse evolutionary modularity and ecomorphology using three-dimensional data from across the entire skeleton in a phylogenetically broad sample of extant birds. We find strongly modular evolution of skeletal element sizes within body regions (head, trunk, forelimb and hindlimb). However, element shapes show substantially less modularity, have stronger relationships to ecology, and provide evidence that ecological adaptation involves coordinated evolution of elements across different body regions. This complicates the straightforward paradigm in which modular evolution facilitated the ecological diversification of birds. Our findings suggest the potential for undetected patterns of morphological evolution in even well-studied groups, and advance the understanding of the interface between evolutionary integration and ecomorphology.},

In Africa, the knowledge of their historical uses as food, medicine, source of income and small scale businesses, and the sociological impacts (myth, culture and spirituality) are apparently threatened due to slow ethnomycology research drive. The poor identification and documentation of edible and medicinal species of mushrooms in many developing nations have created some degrees of inconsistencies in their usages relative to folk medicine practice, food and mythological beliefs. Their relevance in modern day pharmaceutics and nutraceuticals is a product of human experimentation over time. Factors that may be anthropogenic, ethnographic, ethnoecological/environmental have been implicated in mushrooms underutilization and under-explora- tion of mushrooms in West Africa. Ethnomycological literatures on West Africa are scant, random, are limited in scope and fraught with taxonomic inconsistencies.

  abstract = {Abstract In the tropics, conversion of woodland and forest into cropland and pasture has risen drastically during the last decade. Rapid population growth and poverty are believed to be the main factors of change in land use in these zones. Southern Burkina Faso experienced rapid population growth due to massive peasants' migration from the north and central regions of the Country, exacerbated by decreasing rainfall and arable land in the area of origin. This paper assessed the impact of such increased population on land use change in the attracting zones from 1986 to 2006. Satellite images were used to measure changes in land cover types over time and national population census data were used to examine the population dynamics over the same time. Results showed that the forest land was progressively converted to croplands at an annualized rate of 0{$\cdot$}96 per cent, while the population density shifted from 17 inhabitants per km2 in 1986 to 30 inhabitants per km2 in 2006. Pearson correlation analysis revealed the positive role of population size and distribution in explaining land cover change. Policy initiatives that will lead to better environmental management are recommended. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements. We use our results to derive hypotheses on species interactions that can be tested in future experimental work.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

  abstract = {Estimation of intra- and interspecific interactions from time-series on species-rich communities is challenging due to the high number of potentially interacting species pairs. The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.},

  abstract = {A key challenge for community ecology is to understand to what extent observational data can be used to infer the underlying community assembly processes. As different processes can lead to similar or even identical patterns, statistical analyses of non-manipulative observational data never yield undisputable causal inference on the underlying processes. Still, most empirical studies in community ecology are based on observational data, and hence understanding under which circumstances such data can shed light on assembly processes is a central concern for community ecologists. We simulated a spatial agent-based model that generates variation in metacommunity dynamics across multiple axes, including the four classic metacommunity paradigms as special cases. We further simulated a virtual ecologist who analysed snapshot data sampled from the simulations using eighteen output metrics derived from beta-diversity and habitat variation indices, variation partitioning and joint species distribution modelling. Our results indicated two main axes of variation in the output metrics. The first axis of variation described whether the landscape has patchy or continuous variation, and thus was essentially independent of the properties of the species community. The second axis of variation related to the level of predictability of the metacommunity. The most predictable communities were niche-based metacommunities inhabiting static landscapes with marked environmental heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the species sorting paradigm or the mass effects paradigm. The most unpredictable communities were neutral-based metacommunities inhabiting dynamics landscapes with little spatial heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the neutral or patch sorting paradigms. The output metrics from joint species distribution modelling yielded generally the highest resolution to disentangle among the simulated scenarios. Yet, the different types of statistical approaches utilized in this study carried complementary information, and thus our results suggest that the most comprehensive evaluation of metacommunity structure can be obtained by combining them.},

  abstract = {The kingdom Fungi is a megadiverse group represented in all ecosystem types. The global diversity and distribution of fungal taxa are poorly known, in part due to the limitations related to traditional fruit-body survey methods. These previous hurdles are now being overcome by rapidly developing DNA-based surveys. Past fungal DNA surveys have predominantly examined soil samples, which capture high species diversity but represent only the local soil community. Recent work has shown that DNA samples collected from the air with cyclone samplers provide information on fungal diversity at the scale of some tens of kilometers around the sampling location. To test the feasibility of air sampling for investigating global patterns of fungal diversity, we established a new initiative called the Global Spore Sampling Project (GSSP). The GSSP currently involves 50 sampling locations distributed on all continents, with each location collecting two 24-h samples per week. Here we describe the GSSP methodology, including the sampling, DNA extraction and sequencing protocols, and the bioinformatics pipeline. We further report results based on 75 pilot samples from five locations, of which three in Europe, one in Australia, and one in Greenland. The results show highly consistent patterns, suggesting that GSSP holds much promise for systematic global fungal monitoring. The GSSP provides highly standardized sampling across space and time, enabling much-improved estimation of total fungal diversity, the global distribution of different fungal groups, fungal fruiting phenology, and the extent of long-distance dispersal in fungi.},

We applied a conservative bioinformatics pipeline that filtered out sequences that did not show strong evidence of representing a fungal species. The pipeline yielded 27,954 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Each OTU is accompanied by a probabilistic taxonomic classification, validated through comparison with expert evaluations. To examine the potential of the data for ecological analyses, we partitioned the variation in species distributions into spatial and seasonal components, showing a strong effect of the annual mean temperature on community composition.},

The rise of open access publishing this century and the freeing of older literature from the shackles of copyright have greatly increased the online availability of taxonomic descriptions, but much of the literature of the mid- to late-twentieth century remains offline (`dark texts'). DNA barcoding is generating a wealth of computable data that in many ways are much easier to work with than classical taxonomic descriptions, but many of the sequences are not identified to species level. These `dark taxa' hamper the classical method of integrating biodiversity data, using shared taxonomic names. Voucher specimens are a potential common currency of both the taxonomic literature and sequence databases, and could be used to help link names, literature and sequences. An obstacle to this approach is the lack of stable, resolvable specimen identifiers. The paper concludes with an appeal for a global `digital dashboard' to assess the extent to which biodiversity data are available online. This article is part of the themed issue `From DNA barcodes to biomes'.},

Especially noticeable effect has been attained in the field of microbial ecology, where new experimental approaches provided in-depth assessments of the composition, functions, and dynamic changes of complex microbial communities. Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amounts of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyze and interpret these datasets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular dataset. In this review we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive, and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world. Finally, we offer suggestions for the selection of appropriate methods based on the research question and dataset structure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {High-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of conserved DNA regions is a powerful technique to characterize microbial communities. Recently, spike-in mock communities have been used to measure accuracy of sequencing platforms and data analysis pipelines. To assess the ability of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines using fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons, we created two ITS spike-in control mock communities composed of cloned DNA in plasmids: a biological mock community, consisting of ITS sequences from fungal taxa, and a synthetic mock community (SynMock), consisting of non-biological ITS-like sequences. Using these spike-in controls we show that: (1) a non-biological synthetic control (e.g., SynMock) is the best solution for parameterizing bioinformatics pipelines, (2) pre-clustering steps for variable length amplicons are critically important, (3) a major source of bias is attributed to the initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thus HTAS read abundances are typically not representative of starting values. We developed AMPtk, a versatile software solution equipped to deal with variable length amplicons and quality filter HTAS data based on spike-in controls. While we describe herein a non-biological SynMock community for ITS sequences, the concept and AMPtk software can be widely applied to any HTAS dataset to improve data quality.},

  abstract = {Allorecognition in fungi takes the form of vegetative incompatibility (VI), a process leading to the programmed cell death of heterokaryotic cells formed after anastomosis between hyphae of genetically incompatible isolates, thereby keeping different genotypes separated. VI is ubiquitous amongst ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, determined by loci named het or vic, and responds to both promoting and limiting selective constraints. While VI has been widely used to analyze fungal populations, genes controlling VI systems have only been characterized at the molecular level in three ascomycete species. VI systems can be considered as having a modular organization, comprised of a polymorphic component for recognition associated with a cell death inducing component often (but not exclusively) including a HET domain protein. However, the actual genes involved differ in sequence and properties. Some VI genes display a patchy phylogenetic distribution, whereas others appear widely conserved in fungal genomes, but their function in controlling VI is restricted to a single or a few related species. It also appears that evolutionary trajectories generating and maintaining polymorphism at these loci differ. Some het genes show low allelic diversity and signs of long term balancing selection and may be specifically selected for allorecognition. Others show high allelic diversity, evidence of positive selection and fast evolution and their products are believed to correspond to immune receptors whose functions have been coopted for allorecognition. Finally, where known, mechanisms for initiating cell death and the cell death reaction itself display similarities and differences between different model species. All these data support the hypothesis that VI is a ubiquitous phenomenon acquired time and time again independently in different fungal lineages.},

  abstract = {Informed decision on the management of natural resources requires an understanding of the complex dynamics of socio-economic and biophysical factors. This study aimed at exploring the land use change in southern Burkina Faso at regional and local levels and the underlying causes of change. The local level study was conducted in two villages, Boala and Yal{\'e}, in Sissili Province. Aerial photos from 1984 and 1997 and satellite images from 1986 and 2002 were employed to describe the land use dynamics. The spatial approach was combined with field data collected in 2003 and 2005 for ground-truth checking and gathering other relevant data. Semi-structured questionnaire was used for gathering data on socio-economic factors driving land use changes at local level. At regional scale, the annual rate of change in forest land, grazing land, gallery forest and cropland was -0.4, -0.9, -1.6 and 3.8\%, respectively. The size of croplands increased by 14\% in some districts with an equivalent annual rate of conversion to cropland estimated at 0.6\% during 1986--2002. At the local level, the size of croplands increased from 7 to 14\% in Boala and from 21 to 30\% in Yal{\'e} at the expense of shrinking of forest cover from 78 to 40\% in the former and from 41 to 18\% in the latter village. Rural migration (3.3\% at regional level, and as high as 97\% in Yal{\'e} and 9\% in Boala) coupled with extensive subsistence farming, large-scale commercial farming, intensive fuelwood extraction and other disturbances were the main factors driving land use change. In conclusion, the results show that in a decade and half the southern region of Burkina Faso has moved from a sparsely populated area with subsistence farming to a more complex zone of production characterized by high competition between different land use types. Integrated management of the natural resources in the region should, therefore, be given more attention.},

Elucidating the timing of diversification among the more than 70 lineages is key to understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we use taxon-rich multigene data combined with diverse fossils and a relaxed molecular clock framework to estimate the timing of the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes and the divergence of major clades. Overall, these analyses suggest that the last common ancestor lived between 1866 and 1679 Ma, consistent with the earliest microfossils interpreted with confidence as eukaryotic. During this interval, the Earth's surface differed markedly from today; for example, the oceans were incompletely ventilated, with ferruginous and, after about 1800 Ma, sulfidic water masses commonly lying beneath moderately oxygenated surface waters. Our time estimates also indicate that the major clades of eukaryotes diverged before 1000 Ma, with most or all probably diverging before 1200 Ma. Fossils, however, suggest that diversity within major extant clades expanded later, beginning about 800 Ma, when the oceans began their transition to a more modern chemical state. In combination, paleontological and molecular approaches indicate that long stems preceded diversification in the major eukaryotic lineages.},

  abstract = {The estimation of phylogenetic trees for individual genes or multi-locus datasets is a basic part of considerable biological research. In order to enable large trees to be computed, Disjoint Tree Mergers (DTMs) have been developed; these methods operate by dividing the input sequence dataset into disjoint sets, constructing trees on each subset, and then combining the subset trees (using auxiliary information) into a tree on the full dataset. DTMs have been used to advantage for multi-locus species tree estimation, enabling highly accurate species trees at reduced computational effort, compared to leading species tree estimation methods. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using DTMs to improve the scalability of maximum likelihood (ML) gene tree estimation to large numbers of input sequences. Our study shows distinct differences between the three selected ML codes---RAxML-NG, IQ-TREE 2, and FastTree 2---and shows that good DTM pipeline design can provide advantages over these ML codes on large datasets.},

  abstract = {Canonical microsporidians are a group of obligate intracellular parasites of a wide range of hosts comprising {\textasciitilde}1,300 species of {$>$}220 genera. Microsporidians are related to fungi, and many characterised and uncharacterized groups closely related to them have been discovered recently, filling the knowledge gaps between them. These groups assigned to the superphylum Opisthosporidia have provided several important insights into the evolution of diverse intracellular parasitic lineages within the tree of eukaryotes. The most studied among opisthosporidians, canonical microsporidians, were known to science more than 160~years ago, however, the classification of canonical Microsporidia has been challenging due to common morphological homoplasy, and accelerated evolutionary rates. Instead of morphological characters, ssrRNA sequences have been used as the primary data for the classification of canonical microsporidians. Previous studies have produced a useful backbone of the microsporidian phylogeny, but provided only some nodal support, causing some confusion. Here, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees of canonical microsporidians using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood inferences. We included rRNA sequences of 126 described/named genera, by far the broadest taxon coverage to date. Overall, our trees show similar topology and recovered four of the five main clades demonstrated in previous studies (Clades 1, 3, 4 and 5). Family level clades were well resolved within each major clade, but many were discordant with the recently revised classification. Therefore, revision and some reshuffling, especially within and between Clades 1 and 3 are required. We also reconstructed phylogenetic trees of Opisthosporidia to better integrate the evolutionary history of canonical microsporidians in a broader context. We discuss several traits shared only by canonical microsporidians that may have contributed to their striking ecological success in diverse metazoans. More targeted studies on the neglected host groups will be of value for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of these interesting intracellular parasites.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic bootstrapping (BS) is a standard technique for inferring confidence values on phylogenetic trees that is based on reconstructing many trees from minor variations of the input data, trees called replicates. BS is used with all phylogenetic reconstruction approaches, but we focus here on one of the most popular, maximum likelihood (ML). Because ML inference is so computationally demanding, it has proved too expensive to date to assess the impact of the number of replicates used in BS on the relative accuracy of the support values. For the same reason, a rather small number (typically 100) of BS replicates are computed in real-world studies. Stamatakis et al. recently introduced a BS algorithm that is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, while yielding qualitatively comparable support values, making an experimental study possible. In this article, we propose stopping criteria---that is, thresholds computed at runtime to determine when enough replicates have been generated---and we report on the first large-scale experimental study to assess the effect of the number of replicates on the quality of support values, including the performance of our proposed criteria. We run our tests on 17 diverse real-world DNA---single-gene as well as multi-gene---datasets, which include 125--2,554 taxa. We find that our stopping criteria typically stop computations after 100--500 replicates (although the most conservative criterion may continue for several thousand replicates) while producing support values that correlate at better than 99.5\% with the reference values on the best ML trees. Significantly, we also find that the stopping criteria can recommend very different numbers of replicates for different datasets of comparable sizes. Our results are thus twofold: (i) they give the first experimental assessment of the effect of the number of BS replicates on the quality of support values returned through BS, and (ii) they validate our proposals for stopping criteria. Practitioners will no longer have to enter a guess nor worry about the quality of support values; moreover, with most counts of replicates in the 100--500 range, robust BS under ML inference becomes computationally practical for most datasets. The complete test suite is available at http://lcbb.epfl.ch/BS.tar.bz2, and BS with our stopping criteria is included in the latest release of RAxML v7.2.5, available at http://wwwkramer.in.tum.de/exelixis/software.html.},

We used the highly parallel microarray technology GeoChip 4.0, which contains 83~992 probes specific for genes linked nutrient cycling and other processes, to evaluate how the diversity, abundance and similarity of the targeted genes responded to forest-to-pasture conversion. We also evaluated whether these parameters were reestablished with secondary forest growth. A spatially nested scheme was employed to sample a primary forest, two pastures (6 and 38~years old) and a secondary forest. Both pastures had significantly lower microbial functional genes richness and diversity when compared to the primary forest. Gene composition and turnover were also significantly modified with land use change. Edaphic traits associated with soil acidity, iron availability, soil texture and organic matter concentration were correlated with these gene changes. Although primary and secondary forests showed similar functional gene richness and diversity, there were differences in gene composition and turnover, suggesting that community recovery was not complete in the secondary forest. Gene association analysis revealed that response to ecosystem conversion varied significantly across functional gene groups, with genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling mostly altered. This study indicates that diversity and abundance of numerous environmentally important genes respond to forest-to-pasture conversion and hence have the potential to affect the related processes at an ecosystem scale.},

  abstract = {Protein sequence similarity searching programs like BLASTP, SSEARCH (UNIT 3.10), and FASTA use scoring matrices that are designed to identify distant evolutionary relationships (BLOSUM62 for BLAST, BLOSUM50 for SEARCH and FASTA). Different similarity scoring matrices are most effective at different evolutionary distances. ``Deep'' scoring matrices like BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50 target alignments with 20 -- 30\% identity, while ``shallow'' scoring matrices (e.g. VTML10 -- VTML80), target alignments that share 90 -- 50\% identity, reflecting much less evolutionary change. While ``deep'' matrices provide very sensitive similarity searches, they also require longer sequence alignments and can sometimes produce alignment overextension into non-homologous regions. Shallower scoring matrices are more effective when searching for short protein domains, or when the goal is to limit the scope of the search to sequences that are likely to be orthologous between recently diverged organisms. Likewise, in DNA searches, the match and mismatch parameters set evolutionary look-back times and domain boundaries. In this unit, we will discuss the theoretical foundations that drive practical choices of protein and DNA similarity scoring matrices and gap penalties. Deep scoring matrices (BLOSUM62 and BLOSUM50) should be used for sensitive searches with full-length protein sequences, but short domains or restricted evolutionary look-back require shallower scoring matrices.},

While such use draws on information at the DNA level, the current amassment of ca. 4.7 million COI barcodes also offers a unique resource for exploring functional constraints on DNA evolution. Here, we explore amino acid variation in a crosscut of the entire animal kingdom. Patterns of DNA variation were linked to functional constraints at the level of the amino acid sequence in functionally important parts of the enzyme. Six amino acid sites show variation with possible effects on enzyme function. Overall, patterns of amino acid variation suggest convergent or parallel evolution at the protein level connected to the transition into a parasitic life style. Denser sampling of two diverse insect taxa revealed that the beetles (Coleoptera) show more amino acid variation than the butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), indicating fundamental difference in patterns of molecular evolution in COI. Several amino acid sites were found to be under notably strong purifying selection in Lepidoptera as compared to Coleoptera. Overall, these findings demonstrate the utility of the global DNA barcode library to extend far beyond identification and taxonomy, and will hopefully be followed by a multitude of work.},

  abstract = {A novel formulation of the important DNA sequence base-calling problem as well as algorithms for its solution are introduced. The proposed approach is to bring DNA base-calling within the framework of a powerful statistical learning paradigm, which allows the incorporation of prior knowledge about the structure of the problem directly into the base-calling algorithms, without resorting to heuristics. Use of prior knowledge provides constraints which help disambiguate the di erent possible interpretations that the data may have at regions of low SNR, and is shown to lead to a substantial increase of the number of DNA bases that can be accurately called in such regions. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithms, without being optimized, can achieve base-calling performance that matches, and often exceeds, that of commercially available software. Furthermore, due to their statistical basis, they also provide con{\"y}dence estimates (in the form of posterior probabilities) for the produced base call decisions, which can be used for sequence assembly and mutation detection purposes. ? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we show that the symbiotic genomic idiosyncrasies of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes are also present in C. geophilum with symbiosis-induced, taxon-specific genes of unknown function and reduced numbers of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. C. geophilum still holds a significant set of genes in categories known to be involved in pathogenesis and shows an increased genome size due to transposable elements proliferation. Transcript profiling revealed a striking upregulation of membrane transporters, including aquaporin water channels and sugar transporters, and mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins (MiSSPs) in ectomycorrhiza compared with free-living mycelium. The frequency with which this symbiont is found on tree roots and its possible role in water and nutrient transport in symbiosis calls for further studies on mechanisms of host and environmental adaptation.},

  abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via ``SNP chip'' microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotypephenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

  abstract = {As third generation sequencing technologies become more reliable and widely used to solve several genome-related problems, self-correction of long reads is becoming the preferred method to reduce the error rate of Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore long reads, that is now around 10-12\%. Several of these self-correction methods rely on some form of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) to obtain a consensus sequence for the original reads. In particular, error-correction tools such as RACON and CONSENT use Partial Order (PO) graph alignment to accomplish this task. PO graph alignment, which is computationally more expensive than optimal global pairwise alignment between two sequences, needs to be performed several times for each read during the error correction process. GPUs have proven very effective in accelerating several computeintensive tasks in different scientific fields. We harnessed the power of these architectures to accelerate the error correction process of existing self-correction tools, to improve the efficiency of this step of genome analysis.In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated version of the PO alignment presented in the POA v2 software library, implemented on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. We obtain up to 6. 5x speedup compared to 64 CPU threads run on two 2.3 GHz 16-core Intel Xeon Processors E5-2698 v3. In our implementation we focused on the alignment of smaller sequences, as the CONSENT segmentation strategy based on k-mer chaining provides an optimal opportunity to exploit the parallel-processing power of GPUs. To demonstrate this, we have integrated our kernel in the CONSENT software. This accelerated version of CONSENT provides a speedup for the whole error correction step that ranges from 1. 95x to 8. 5x depending on the input reads.},

All species demonstrated significantly higher colonization rates on WS and CW than on PS. WS supported faster growth of A. aegerita and Pleurotus spp., whereas V. volvacea performed better on CW. Comparison of growth rates on composted and non-composted WS and CW substrates revealed that in the latter case faster colonization was achieved, particularly for Pleurotus spp. However, one commercial strain of V. volvacea presented higher growth rates when the composted CW medium was used. Furthermore, earliness in the fructification of P. ostreatus, P. pulmonarius and V. volvacea strains was promoted in CW substrates, while WS favoured earliness of P. eryngii and A. aegerita. Similarly, high sporophore yields were obtained by P. ostreatus and P. pulmonarius on both wastes, whereas WS enhanced yield and basidioma size of P. eryngii and A. aegerita strains and CW production of V. volvacea. The substrates cellulose:lignin ratios were found to be positively correlated to mycelial growth rates and to mushroom yield of P. ostreatus and P. pulmonarius; in addition, positive correlation was also detected for carbon:nitrogen ratio and mushroom yield in P. eryngii and A. aegerita and between cellulose content and mushroom yield for V. volvacea strains.},

Learning goals were defined based on concepts taught throughout the cell biology lab course and learning objectives specific to the PCR and gel electrophoresis lab. Exercises developed to promote critical thinking and target the underlying concepts of PCR, primer design, gel analysis, and troubleshooting were incorporated into an existing lab unit based on the detection of genetically modified organisms. Evaluative assessments for each exercise were aligned with the learning goals and used to measure student learning achievements. Our analysis found that the exercises were effective in enhancing student understanding of these concepts as shown by student performance across all learning goals. The new materials were particularly helpful in acquiring relevant knowledge, fostering critical-thinking skills, and uncovering prevalent misconceptions.},

  abstract = {Microbial ecology has made large advances over the last decade, mostly because of improvements in molecular analysis techniques that have enabled the detection and identification of progressively larger numbers of microbial species. However, determining the ecological patterns and processes taking place in communities of microbes remains a significant challenge. Are communities randomly assembled through dispersal and priority effects, or do species interact with each other leading to positive and negative associations? For mycorrhizal fungi, evidence is accumulating that stochastic and competitive interactions between species may both have a role in shaping community structure. Could the methodological approach, which is often incidence based, impact the outcomes detected? Here, we applied an incidence-based Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) database approach to examine species diversity and ecological interactions within a community of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the ECM community colonizing root tips was strongly structured by competitive interactions, or ecological processes generating a similar spatial pattern, rather than neutral processes. Analysis of b-diversity indicated that community structure was significantly more similar (spatially autocorrelated) at distances equal to or {$<$}3.41 m. The eight most frequently encountered species in the root tip community of ECM fungi displayed significant competitive interactions with at least one other species, showing that the incidence-based approach was capable of detecting this sort of ecological information.},

  abstract = {Scientific information about biodiversity distribution is indispensable for nature conservation and sustainable management of natural resources. For several groups of animals and plants, such data are available, but for fungi, especially in tropical regions like West Africa, they are mostly missing. Here, information for West African countries about species diversity of fungi and fungus-like organisms (other organisms traditionally studied by mycologists) is compiled from literature and analysed in its historical context for the first time. More than 16,000 records of fungi representing 4843 species and infraspecific taxa were found in 860 publications relating to West Africa. Records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database (2395 species), and that of the former International Mycological Institute fungal reference collection (IMI) (2526 species) were also considered. The compilation based on literature is more comprehensive than the GBIF and IMI data, although they include 914 and 679 species names, respectively, which are not present in the checklist based on literature. According to data available in literature, knowledge on fungal richness ranges from 19 species (Guinea Bissau) to 1595 (Sierra Leone). In estimating existing species diversity, richness estimators and the Hawksworth 6:1 fungus to plant species ratio were used. Based on the Hawksworth ratio, known fungal diversity in West Africa represents 11.4\% of the expected diversity. For six West African countries, however, known fungal species diversity is less than 2\%. Incomplete knowledge of fungal diversity is also evident by species accumulation curves not reaching saturation, by 45.3\% of the fungal species in the checklist being cited only once for West Africa, and by 66.5\% of the fungal species in the checklist reported only for a single country. The documentation of different systematic groups of fungi is very heterogeneous because historically investigations have been sporadic. Recent opportunistic sampling activities in Benin showed that it is not difficult to find specimens representing new country records. Investigation of fungi in West Africa started just over two centuries ago and it is still in an early pioneer phase. To promote proper exploration, the present checklist is provided as a tool to facilitate fungal identification in this region and to aid conceptualisation and justification of future research projects. Documentation of fungal diversity is urgently needed because natural habitats are being lost on a large scale through altered land use and climate change.},

The remaining genotype comprised 13 basidiomes and covered an area of at least 300 m2, with maximum measured dimensions of 40 m and 14 m. This is the largest genet of an ectomycorrhizal fungus described to date, and is likely the result of vegetative growth, because analysis of single spore isolates eliminates the possibility of genetic identity resulting from either apomixis or fortuitously indistinguishable recombinant genotypes. Genetic analysis also shows that although out-crossing appears to predominate in the population, at least a low percentage (1-4 \%) of spores are secondarily homothallic.},

Unfortunately, the search for the optimal phylogenetic tree incurs significant computational costs, and most of the existing state-of-the-art tools cannot deal with extremely large datasets in reasonable times.In this work, we introduce the new VeryFastTree code (version 4.0), which is able to construct a tree on 1 server using single-precision arithmetic from a massive 1 million alignment dataset in only 36~hours, which is 3 times and 3.2 times faster than its previous version and FastTree-2, respectively. This new version further boosts performance by parallelizing all tree traversal operations during the tree construction process, including subtree pruning and regrafting moves. Additionally, it introduces significant new features such as support for new and compressed file formats, enhanced compatibility across a broader range of operating systems, and the integration of disk computing functionality. The latter feature is particularly advantageous for users without access to high-end servers, as it allows them to manage very large datasets, albeit with an increase in computing time.Experimental results establish VeryFastTree as the fastest tool in the state-of-the-art for maximum likelihood phylogeny estimation. It is publicly available at https://github.com/citiususc/veryfasttree. In addition, VeryFastTree is included as a package in Bioconda, MacPorts, and all Debian-based Linux distributions.},

  abstract = {Appropriate design and selection of PCR primers plays a critical role in determining the sensitivity and specificity of a metabarcoding assay. Despite several studies applying metabarcoding to insect pest surveillance, the diagnostic performance of the short ``mini-barcodes'' required by high-throughput sequencing platforms has not been established across the broader taxonomic diversity of invasive insects. We address this by computationally evaluating the diagnostic sensitivity and predicted amplification bias for 68 published and novel cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) primers on a curated database of 110,676 insect species, including 2,625 registered on global invasive species lists. We find that mini-barcodes between 125-257 bp can provide comparable resolution to the full-length barcode for both invasive insect pests and the broader Insecta, conditional upon the subregion of COI targeted and the genetic similarity threshold used to identify species. Taxa that could not be identified by any barcode lengths were phylogenetically clustered within `problem groups', many arising through taxonomic inconsistencies rather than insufficient diagnostic information within the barcode itself. Substantial variation in predicted PCR bias was seen across published primers, with those including 4-5 degenerate nucleotide bases showing almost no mismatch to major insect orders. While not completely universal, a single COI mini-barcode can successfully differentiate the majority of pest and non-pest insects from their congenerics, even at the small amplicon size imposed by 2 {\texttimes} 150 bp sequencing. We provide a ranked summary of high-performing primers and discuss the bioinformatic steps required to curate reliable reference databases for metabarcoding studies.},

  abstract = {Biogeographers often stress the importance of considering all biotic groups when searching for generalizations about the distribution of organisms in space and time. Biotas consist of associated and coevolved organisms, strictly dependent or interdependent, yet having different life histories and dispersal capabilities. Data derived from studies of such associations should more rigorously test biogeographical scenarios calling for either dispersion* or migration* as the mechanism responsible for disjunct distributions. Despite frequent references to the potential significance of data awaiting discovery, especially within the realm of microorganisms, and complaints about chronic inadequacy of data provided by anyone group of organisms individually, few biogeographers have ventured from the well-trodden tracks of zoo- and phytogeography into the microbial underworld or sought cooperation of workers in these more 'peripheral' disciplines. Consistently neglected are the Fungi which are now widely acknowledged to represent the third major Kingdom of land-based organisms. As obligate carbon heterotrophs, the fungi have been intimately linked with plants throughout their long history, and are a potentially rich source of phytogeographical data because the association is often sufficiently close and specialized to impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of components either individually or in partnership. The evolution of the now dominant groups of phytotrophic fungi is probably linked with, and parallels the rise to dominance of, the angiosperms. However, the history of the Fungi extends beyond that of the angiosperms and is often marked by morphological and ecological stability of low-ranking taxa since the Mesozoic or earlier (Pirozynski 1976). The fossil history of fungi is still fragmentary but, as records accumulate, fungal data may offer clues to phylogenetic and geographical relationships between extinct and extant angiosperms, as well as between the angiosperms and their precursors. Why, then, have fungi been almost totally ignored by biogeographers? Several legitimate factors, as well as some misconceptions, have contributed to the situation. The major obstacle to the pursuit of mycogeography is our still poor understanding of phylogenetic relationships within the fungi. Hierarchies of taxa based on biological relatedness are the fundamental units of biogeography. Mycological taxa are more typological than zoological or botanical, more open to different interpretations and consequently less reliable as biogeographical units.},

  abstract = {Ecological studies may produce presence-absence data sets for different taxonomic groups, with varying spatial resolution and temporal coverage. Comparisons of these data are needed to extract meaningful information on the background ecological factors explaining community patterns, to improve our understanding of how beta diversity and its components vary among communities and biogeographical regions, and to reveal their possible implications for biodiversity conservation. A methodological difficulty is that the number of sampling units may be unequal: no method has been designed as yet to compare data matrices in such cases. The problem is solved by converting presence-absence data matrices to simplex plots based on the decomposition of Jaccard dissimilarity into species replacement and richness difference fractions used together with the complementary similarity function. Pairs of simplex plots representing different data matrices are then compared by quantifying, for each of them, the relative frequency of points in small, pre-defined subregions of the simplex, and then calculating a divergence function between the two frequency distributions. Given more than two data matrices, classification and ordination techniques may be used to obtain a synthetic and informative picture of metacommunity structure. We demonstrate the potential of our data analytical model by applying it to different case studies spanning different spatial scales and taxonomic levels (Mediterranean Island faunas; Finnish stream macroinvertebrate assemblages; Hungarian forest assemblages), and to a study of temporal changes in small islands (insect fauna in Florida). We conclude that, by accounting for various structural aspects simultaneously, the method permits a thorough ecological interpretation of presence-absence data. Furthermore, the examples illustrate succinctly how similarity, beta diversity and two of its additive components, species replacement and richness difference influence presence-absence patterns under different conditions.},

Over the past decades, rapid development and affordability of molecular tools have tremendously improved insights of the fungal diversity in all ecosystems and habitats. Yet, in spite of the progress of molecular methods, knowledge about functional properties of the fungal taxa is vague and interpretation of environmental studies in an ecologically meaningful manner remains challenging. In order to facilitate functional assignments and ecological interpretation of environmental studies we introduce a user friendly traits and character database FungalTraits operating at genus and species hypothesis levels. Combining the information from previous efforts such as FUNGuild and FunFun together with involvement of expert knowledge, we reannotated 10,210 and 151 fungal and Stramenopila genera, respectively. This resulted in a stand-alone spreadsheet dataset covering 17 lifestyle related traits of fungal and Stramenopila genera, designed for rapid functional assignments of environmental studies. In order to assign the trait states to fungal species hypotheses, the scientific community of experts manually categorised and assigned available trait information to 697,413 fungal ITS sequences. On the basis of those sequences we were able to summarise trait and host information into 92,623 fungal species hypotheses at 1\% dissimilarity threshold.},

  abstract = {Bias introduced by the simultaneous amplification of specific genes from complex mixtures of templates remains poorly understood. To explore potential causes and the extent of bias in PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs), genomic DNAs of two closely and one distantly related bacterial species were mixed and amplified with universal, degenerate primers. Quantification and comparison of template and product ratios showed that there was considerable and reproducible overamplification of specific templates. Variability between replicates also contributed to the observed bias but in a comparatively minor way. Based on these initial observations, template dosage and differences in binding energies of permutations of the degenerate, universal primers were tested as two likely causes of this template-specific bias by using 16S rDNA templates modified by site-directed mutagenesis. When mixtures of mutagenized templates containing AT- and GC-rich priming sites were used, templates containing the GC-rich permutation amplified with higher efficiency, indicating that different primer binding energies may to a large extent be responsible for overamplification. In contrast, gene copy number was found to be an unlikely cause of the observed bias. Similarly, amplification from DNA extracted from a natural community to which different amounts of genomic DNA of a single bacterial species were added did not affect relative product ratios. Bias was reduced considerably by using high template concentrations, by performing fewer cycles, and by mixing replicate reaction preparations.},

  abstract = {Cataloging the very large number of undescribed species of insects could be greatly accelerated by automated DNA based approaches, but procedures for large-scale species discovery from sequence data are currently lacking. Here, we use mitochondrial DNA variation to delimit species in a poorly known beetle radiation in the genus Rivacindela from arid Australia. Among 468 individuals sampled from 65 sites and multiple morphologically distinguishable types, sequence variation in three mtDNA genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, cytochrome b, 16S ribosomal RNA) was strongly partitioned between 46 or 47 putative species identified with quantitative methods of species recognition based on fixed unique (``diagnostic'') characters. The boundaries between groups were also recognizable from a striking increase in branching rate in clock-constrained calibrated trees. Models of stochastic lineage growth (Yule models) were combined with coalescence theory to develop a new likelihood method that determines the point of transition from species-level (speciation and extinction) to population-level (coalescence) evolutionary processes. Fitting the location of the switches from speciation to coalescent nodes on the ultrametric tree of Rivacindela produced a transition in branching rate occurring at 0.43 Mya, leading to an estimate of 48 putative species (confidence interval for the threshold ranging from 47 to 51 clusters within 2 logL units). Entities delimited in this way exhibited biological properties of traditionally defined species, showing coherence of geographic ranges, broad congruence with morphologically recognized species, and levels of sequence divergence typical for closely related species of insects. The finding of discontinuous evolutionary groupings that are readily apparent in patterns of sequence variation permits largely automated species delineation from DNA surveys of local communities as a scaffold for taxonomy in this poorly known insect group.},

  abstract = {Nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA is widely used in fungal phylogenetics and to an increasing extent also amplicon-based environmental sequencing. The relatively short reads produced by next-generation sequencing, however, makes primer choice and sequence error important variables for obtaining accurate taxonomic classifications. In this simulation study we tested the performance of three classification methods: 1) a similarity-based method (BLAST + Metagenomic Analyzer, MEGAN); 2) a composition-based method (Ribosomal Database Project na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier, NBC); and, 3) a phylogeny-based method (Statistical Assignment Package, SAP). We also tested the effects of sequence length, primer choice, and sequence error on classification accuracy and perceived community composition. Using a leave-one-out cross validation approach, results for classifications to the genus rank were as follows: BLAST + MEGAN had the lowest error rate and was particularly robust to sequence error; SAP accuracy was highest when long LSU query sequences were classified; and, NBC runs significantly faster than the other tested methods. All methods performed poorly with the shortest 50--100 bp sequences. Increasing simulated sequence error reduced classification accuracy. Community shifts were detected due to sequence error and primer selection even though there was no change in the underlying community composition. Short read datasets from individual primers, as well as pooled datasets, appear to only approximate the true community composition. We hope this work informs investigators of some of the factors that affect the quality and interpretation of their environmental gene surveys.},

The inclusion of pseudogene sequences in DNA barcoding and metabarcoding analysis can lead to misleading results.

The purpose of this study is to develop a method to screen for nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (nuMTs) in large COI datasets. We do this by: (1) describing gene and nuMT characteristics from an artificial COI barcode dataset, (2) show the impact of two different pseudogene removal methods on perturbed community datasets with simulated nuMTs, and (3) incorporate a pseudogene filtering step in a bioinformatic pipeline that can be used to process Illumina paired-end COI metabarcode sequences.

Water quality improvement provided by constructed wetlands is well known, but little is known about the ecological function of these treatment systems. A passive treatment system was constructed in eastern Oklahoma to treat AMD from an abandoned coal mine. Multiple water quality parameters were monitored. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined throughout the system to estimate productivity. Multi-plate artificial substrate samplers were deployed to quantify and evaluate the macroinvertebrate assemblage within each cell. Productivity between treatment cells varied significantly. The cells receiving effluent from anoxic organic substrate had elevated nutrient levels, which led to elevated productivity. Chlorophyll a levels reached hypereutrophic conditions into final treatment cells. Macroinvertebrate community structure was significantly different among treatment cells. Primary cells produced more diverse and evenly distributed taxa, including the presence of moderately intolerant taxa. The treatment system exhibited early successional stage ecosystem functions and trends toward destructive oscillations.},

Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Methodology/Principal Findings Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the ``CAT'' approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100--1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

  abstract = {Fungi provide important forest ecosystem services worldwide. In Mediterranean pine forests, predicted warmer and drier conditions could lead to a decline in mushroom yields. Climate is a key factor regulating both tree growth and fungal yields, particularly in drought-prone Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the responses of forest growth and mushroom production to climate depend on the differences among tree and fungal species and functional groups (e.g., mycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic), forest types, as well as depending on site conditions. Here we investigate how climatic conditions drive seasonal wood formation (earlywood -EW- and latewood -LW- production) and mycorrhizal mushroom production, to disentangle if growth and fungal yields are related. This assessment was done in Mediterranean forests dominated by four pine species in two areas located in Catalonia (NE Spain) representing mesic and xeric conditions and encompassing wide ecological gradients. The data consisted of 7-year to 13-year long inventories of mushroom production. EW production was favoured by cold and wet climate conditions during the previous fall and winter, and during the current spring and summer. LW production was enhanced by warm and humid conditions from spring to early fall. Mushroom yield was improved by wet late-summer and fall conditions, mainly in the most xeric area. This study confirms the ample differences found in tree growth and fungal production along ecological and climatic gradients. Clear relationships between mycorrhizal fungal yields and tree growth were mostly observed in specific sites characterized by severe summer drought. Specifically, latewood production seems to be the tree-ring variable most tightly linked to mycorrhizal fungal yield in drought-prone areas.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial genomes---in particular those of fungi---often encode genes with a large number of Group I and Group II introns that are conserved at both the sequence and the RNA structure level. They provide a rich resource for the investigation of intron and gene structure, self- and protein-guided splicing mechanisms, and intron evolution. Yet, the degree of sequence conservation of introns is limited, and the primary sequence differs considerably among the distinct intron sub-groups. It makes intron identification, classification, structural modeling, and the inference of gene models a most challenging and error-prone task---frequently passed on to an ``expert'' for manual intervention. To reduce the need for manual curation of intron structures and mitochondrial gene models, computational methods using ERPIN sequence profiles were initially developed in 2007. Here we present a refinement of search models and alignments using the now abundant publicly available fungal mtDNA sequences. In addition, we have tested in how far members of the originally proposed sub-groups are clearly distinguished and validated by our computational approach. We confirm clearly distinct mitochondrial Group I sub-groups IA1, IA3, IB3, IC1, IC2, and ID. Yet, IB1, IB2, and IB4 ERPIN models are overlapping substantially in predictions, and are therefore combined and reported as IB. We have further explored the conversion of our ERPIN profiles into covariance models (CM). Current limitations and prospects of the CM approach will be discussed.},

To gain insight into the recent evolution of C. metapsilosis and the genetic basis of its virulence, we sequenced the genome of 11 clinical isolates from various locations, which we compared to each other and to the available genomes of the two remaining members of the complex: C. orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis. Unexpectedly, we found compelling genomic evidence that C. metapsilosis is a highly heterozygous hybrid species, with all sequenced clinical strains resulting from the same past hybridization event involving two parental lineages that were approximately 4.5\% divergent in sequence. This result indicates that the parental species are non-pathogenic, but that hybridization between them formed a new opportunistic pathogen, C. metapsilosis, that has achieved a worldwide distribution. We show that these hybrids are diploid and we identified strains carrying loci for both alternative mating types, which supports mating as the initial mechanism for hybrid formation. We trace the aftermath of this hybridization at the genomic level, and reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the different strains. Recombination and introgression -resulting in loss of heterozygosis- between the two subgenomes have been rampant, and includes the partial overwriting of the MTLa mating locus in all strains. Collectively, our results shed light on the recent genomic evolution within the C. parapsilosis sensu lato complex, and argue for a re-definition of species within this clade, with at least five distinct homozygous lineages, some of which having the ability to form hybrids.},

Sequencing errors can cause the mis-clustering of otherwise similar reads, artificially increasing the number of retrieved Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and therefore leading to the overestimation of microbial diversity. Sequencing errors will also result in OTUs that are not accurate reconstructions of the original biological sequences. Herein we present the Poisson binomial filtering algorithm (PBF), which minimizes both problems by calculating the error-probability distribution of a sequence from its quality scores. In order to validate our method, we quality-filtered 37 publicly available datasets obtained by sequencing mock and environmental microbial communities with the Roche 454, Illumina MiSeq and IonTorrent PGM platforms, and compared our results to those obtained with previous approaches such as the ones included in mothur, QIIME and USEARCH. Our algorithm retained substantially more reads than its predecessors, while resulting in fewer and more accurate OTUs. This improved sensitiveness produced more faithful representations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the true microbial diversity present in the studied samples. Furthermore, the method introduced in this work is computationally inexpensive and can be readily applied in conjunction with any existent analysis pipeline.},

  abstract = {Within uncharacterized groups, DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences that are present in a wide range of species, can be used to assign organisms into species. We propose an automatic procedure that sorts the sequences into hypothetical species based on the barcode gap, which can be observed whenever the divergence among organisms belonging to the same species is smaller than divergence among organisms from different species. We use a range of prior intraspecific divergence to infer from the data a model-based one-sided confidence limit for intraspecific divergence. The method, called Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), then detects the barcode gap as the first significant gap beyond this limit and uses it to partition the data. Inference of the limit and gap detection are then recursively applied to previously obtained groups to get finer partitions until there is no further partitioning. Using six published data sets of metazoans, we show that ABGD is computationally efficient and performs well for standard prior maximum intraspecific divergences (a few per cent of divergence for the five data sets), except for one data set where less than three sequences per species were sampled. We further explore the theoretical limitations of ABGD through simulation of explicit speciation and population genetics scenarios. Our results emphasize in particular the sensitivity of the method to the presence of recent speciation events, via (unrealistically) high rates of speciation or large numbers of species. In conclusion, ABGD is fast, simple method to split a sequence alignment data set into candidate species that should be complemented with other evidence in an integrative taxonomic approach.},

The evolutionary process may vary within groups of genes, among sites within a gene, between populations and among diverged species. Evolutionary models aiming to describe these dynamics must account for base pair substitutions as well as insertion and deletion (indel) events. Here, we explain the fundamental of continuous time Markov models used to describe sequence evolution. We begin by describing discrete Markov models, and slowly progress towards more realistic and more computationally complicated continuous time Markov models. Among other topics, we discuss nucleotide, amino acid, and codon models, among site rate variation, model reversibility, stationary distributions, rate matrix normalization, mixture models, indel models, and models of gene family evolution. Understanding the concepts presented here is vital for various phylogenom-ics analyses such as the inference of positive selection, alignment and phylogeny reconstruction, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and molecular dating.},

  abstract = {Ophiocordycipitaceae is a diverse family comprising ecologically, economically, medicinally, and culturally important fungi. The family was recognized due to the polyphyly of the genus Cordyceps and the broad diversity of the mostly arthropod-pathogenic lineages of Hypocreales. The other two cordyceps-like families, Cordycipitaceae and Clavicipitaceae, will be revised taxonomically elsewhere. Historically, many species were placed in Cordyceps, but other genera have been described in this family as well, including several based on anamorphic features. Currently there are 24 generic names in use across both asexual and sexual life stages for species of Ophiocordycipitaceae. To reflect changes in Art. 59 in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), we propose to protect and to suppress names within Ophiocordycipitaceae, and to present taxonomic revisions in the genus Tolypocladium, based on rigorous and extensively sampled molecular phylogenetic analyses. When approaching this task, we considered the principles of priority, monophyly, minimizing taxonomic revisions, and the practical utility of these fungi within the wider biological research community.},

  abstract = {Theories of causality in ecology and evolution rarely lend themselves to analysis by the formal method of "hypothesis testing" envisioned by champions of a "strong inference" model of scientific method. The objective of biological research typically is to assess the relative contributions of a number of potential causal agents operating simultaneously. Sensibly stated hypotheses in the methodology of most field investigations are similar to hypotheses of applied statistics. They are not intended to be mutually exclusive, in any sense exhaustive, or global in their application. It is not possible in principle to perform a "critical test" or experiment to distinguish between the truth of "alternative hypotheses" if the proposed causal processes they caricature occur simultaneously. We consider several examples in which a rigid hypothetico-deductive methodology applied to nonalternative ecological "hypotheses" could lead to fallacious conclusions. It has been proposed that processes of ecological succession may be separated into alternative modes of "facilitation," "inhibition," and "tolerance." Yet attempts to experimentally reject one or more of the supposedly distinct hypotheses cannot, in principle, distinguish between them in a variety of biologically interesting cases. In studies of the limits of distributions of intertidal organisms, reasonable univariate experimental tests of possible causes would lead to rejection of "biological enemy" hypotheses when a "keystone predator effect" occurs because the interaction between competition and predation reverses the direction of the effect on some prey populations expected from either process in isolation. Particular problems arise when "null models" in ecology are treated as hypotheses of "strong inference." Models of ecological or evolutionary causality rarely have single or easily stated "null" converses. Tractable null models have no probability of being strictly true, and thus may be rejected a priori as hypothetico-deductive constructs. In practice, their role is as a reference point for measurement of departures. Their usefulness in this regard depends upon the reliability with which the characteristics of biology without interaction can be estimated. Applied to studies of interspecific competition through the use of species distributions, purported null hypotheses make different biological assumptions than those of the interactive models. They seem neither especially more reliable nor in any way more fundamental. We see no reason to accept the recent claims that "null hypotheses," as applied in ecology and evolution, have any logical primacy or greater parsimony than other approaches to partitioning the variation observed in natural communities among the contributions of many observable causes. Careful consideration of possible explanations and controlled experimentation contribute a great deal to ecological and evolutionary knowledge. However, we believe that the hypothetico-deductive model of scientific method can provide misleading prescriptions for efficient investigation and acceptance of evidence in phenomena with multiple causes, and should be applied with appropriate skepticism.},

  abstract = {Pairwise sequence alignment is undoubtedly a central tool in many bioinformatics analyses. In this paper, we present a generically accelerated module for pairwise sequence alignments applicable for a broad range of applications. In our module, we unified the standard dynamic programming kernel used for pairwise sequence alignments and extended it with a generalized inter-sequence vectorization layout, such that many alignments can be computed simultaneously by exploiting SIMD (single instruction multiple data) instructions of modern processors. We then extended the module by adding two layers of thread-level parallelization, where we (a) distribute many independent alignments on multiple threads and (b) inherently parallelize a single alignment computation using a work stealing approach producing a dynamic wavefront progressing along the minor diagonal.We evaluated our alignment vectorization and parallelization on different processors, including the newest Intel{\textregistered} Xeon{\textregistered} (Skylake) and Intel{\textregistered} Xeon PhiTM (KNL) processors, and use cases. The instruction set AVX512-BW (Byte and Word), available on Skylake processors, can genuinely improve the performance of vectorized alignments. We could run single alignments 1600 times faster on the Xeon PhiTM and 1400 times faster on the Xeon{\textregistered} than executing them with our previous sequential alignment module.The module is programmed in C++\,using the SeqAn (Reinert et al., 2017) library and distributed with version 2.4 under the BSD license. We support SSE4, AVX2, AVX512 instructions and included UME: SIMD, a SIMD-instruction wrapper library, to extend our module for further instruction sets. We thoroughly test all alignment components with all major C++\,compilers on various platforms.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Oligotyping is a novel, supervised computational method that classifies closely related sequences into ``oligotypes'' (OTs) based on subtle nucleotide variation (Eren et al., ). Its application to microbial datasets has helped reveal ecological patterns which are often hidden by the way sequence data are currently clustered to define operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Here, we implemented the OT entropy decomposition procedure and its unsupervised version, Minimal Entropy Decomposition (MED; Eren et al., ), in the statistical programming language and environment, R. The aim of this implementation is to facilitate the integration of computational routines, interactive statistical analyses, and visualization into a single framework. In addition, two complementary approaches are implemented: (1) An analytical method (the broken stick model) is proposed to help identify OTs of low abundance that could be generated by chance alone and (2) a one-pass profiling (OP) method, to efficiently identify those OTUs whose subsequent oligotyping would be most promising to be undertaken. These enhancements are especially useful for large datasets, where a manual screening of entropy analysis results and the creation of a full set of OTs may not be feasible. The package and procedures are illustrated by several tutorials and examples.},

  abstract = {Until now the most efficient solution to align nucleotide sequences containing open reading frames was to use indirect procedures that align amino acid translation before reporting the inferred gap positions at the codon level. There are two important pitfalls with this approach. Firstly, any premature stop codon impedes using such a strategy. Secondly, each sequence is translated with the same reading frame from beginning to end, so that the presence of a single additional nucleotide leads to both aberrant translation and alignment. We present an algorithm that has the same space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm while accommodating sequencing errors and other biological deviations from the coding frame. The resulting pairwise coding sequence alignment method was extended to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm implemented in a program called MACSE (Multiple Alignment of Coding SEquences accounting for frameshifts and stop codons). MACSE is the first automatic solution to align protein-coding gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting the underlying codon structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public database sequences and in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding sequence. MACSE is distributed as an open-source java file executable with freely available source code and can be used via a web interface at: http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/macse.},

Here we reflect on this perspective and contest that the view of GC conflicts with some basic and indisputable principles underpinning the philosophy of science, most notably: it must be free. They appear to believe that taxonomic revisions should be based on political, economic and conservation concerns, and they treat species as fixed real entities, instead of refutable scientific hypotheses. In addition to such theoretical misconceptions, GC did not consider important practical aspects of what they term taxonomic anarchy, most significantly the participation of conservationists as authors of taxonomic works, and the importance of alternative management units, a well-established discussion in conservation biology.},

Clustering runs on the DAP are compared with the most efficient algorithms currently available implemented on an IBM 3083 BX. The DAP is found to be 2.9--7.9 times as fast as the IBM, the exact degree of speed-up depending on the size of the dataset, the clustering method, and the serial clustering algorithm that is used. An analysis of the cycle times of the two machines is presented which suggests that further, very substantial speed-ups could be obtained from array processors of this type if they were to be based on more powerful processing elements.},

  abstract = {Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.},

  abstract = {RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players in the regulation of gene expression. In this chapter we discuss the main protein--RNA recognition modes used by RBPs in order to regulate multiple steps of RNA processing. We discuss traditional and state-of-the-art technologies that can be used to study RNAs bound by individual RBPs, or vice versa, for both in vitro and in vivo methodologies. To help highlight the biological significance of RBP mediated regulation, online resources on experimentally verified protein--RNA interactions are briefly presented. Finally, we present the major tools to computationally infer RNA binding sites according to the modeling features and to the unsupervised or supervised frameworks that are adopted. Since some RNA binding site search algorithms are derived from DNA binding site search algorithms, we discuss the commonalities and novelties introduced to handle both sequence and structural features uniquely characterizing protein--RNA interactions.},

Recommendations are made for which of the competing generic names should be used based on criteria such as priority, number of potential names changes, and frequency of use. Some recommendations for well- known genera include Arthrinium over Apiospora, Colletotrichum over Glomerella, Menispora over Zignoella, Microdochium over Monographella, Nigrospora over Khuskia, and Plectosphaerella over Plectosporium. All competing generic names are listed in a table of recommended names along with the required action. If priority is not accorded to sexually typified generic names after 2017, only four names would require formal protection: Chaetosphaerella over Oedemium, Diatrype over Libertella, Microdochium over Monographella, and Phaeoacremonium over Romellia and Togninia. Concerning species in the recommended genera, one replacement name (Xylaria benjaminii nom. nov.) is introduced, and the following new combinations are made: Arthrinium sinense, Chloridium caesium, C. chloroconium, C. gonytrichii, Corollospora marina, C. parvula, C. ramulosa, Juncigena fruticosae, Melanospora simplex, Seimatosporium massarina, Sporoschisma daemonoropis, S. taitense, Torpedospora mangrovei, Xylaria penicilliopsis, and X. termiticola combs. nov.},

  abstract = {Beauveria is a globally distributed genus of soil-borne entomopathogenic hyphomycetes of interest as a model system for the study of entomo-pathogenesis and the biological control of pest insects. Species recognition in Beauveria is difficult due to a lack of taxonomically informative morphology. This has impeded assessment of species diversity in this genus and investigation of their natural history. A gene-genealogical approach was used to investigate molecular phylogenetic diversity of Beauveria and several presumptively related Cordyceps species. Analyses were based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-{$\alpha$}) sequences for 86 exemplar isolates from diverse geographic origins, habitats and insect hosts. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian likelihood methods. Six well supported clades within Beauveria, provisionally designated A--F, were resolved in the EF1-{$\alpha$} and combined gene phylogenies. Beauveria bassiana, a ubiquitous species that is characterized morphologically by globose to subglobose conidia, was determined to be non-monophyletic and consists of two unrelated lineages, clades A and C. Clade A is globally distributed and includes the Asian teleomorph Cordyceps staphylinidaecola and its probable synonym C. bassiana. All isolates contained in Clade C are anamorphic and originate from Europe and North America. Clade B includes isolates of B. brongniartii, a Eurasian species complex characterized by ellipsoidal conidia. Clade D includes B. caledonica and B. vermiconia, which produce cylindrical and comma-shaped conidia, respectively. Clade E, from Asia, includes Beauveria anamorphs and a Cordyceps teleomorph that both produce ellipsoidal conidia. Clade F, the basal branch in the Beauveria phylogeny includes the South American species B. amorpha, which produces cylindrical conidia. Lineage diversity detected within clades A, B and C suggests that prevailing morphological species concepts underestimate species diversity within these groups. Continental endemism of lineages in B. bassiana s.l. (clades A and C) indicates that isolation by distance has been an important factor in the evolutionary diversification of these clades. Permutation tests indicate that host association is essentially random in both B. bassiana s.l. clades A and C, supporting past assumptions that this species is not host specific. In contrast, isolates in clades B and D occurred primarily on coleopteran hosts, although sampling in these clades was insufficient to assess host affliation at lower taxonomic ranks. The phylogenetic placement of Cordyceps staphylinidaecola/bassiana, and C. scarabaeicola within Beauveria corroborates prior reports of these anamorph-teleomorph connections. These results establish a phylogenetic framework for further taxonomic, phylogenetic and comparative biological investigations of Beauveria and their corresponding Cordyceps teleomorphs.},

Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) are key components for the sustainability and functioning of these ecosystems. The community structure and composition of ECMF associated with Q. suber in different landscapes of distinct Mediterranean bioclimate regions have not previously been compared. In this work, soil samples from cork oak forests residing in different bioclimates (arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid) were collected and surveyed for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root tips. A global analysis performed on 3565 ECM root tips revealed that the ECMF community is highly enriched in Russula, Tomentella, and Cenoccocum, which correspond to the ECMF genera that mainly contribute to community differences. The ECMF communities from the rainiest and the driest cork oak forests were distinct, with soils from the rainiest climates being more heterogeneous than those from the driest climates. The analyses of several abiotic factors on the ECMF communities revealed that bioclimate, precipitation, soil texture, and forest management strongly influenced ECMF structure. Shifts in ECMF with different hyphal exploration types were also detected among forests, with precipitation, forest system, and soil texture being the main drivers controlling their composition. Understanding the effects of environmental factors on the structuring of ECM communities could be the first step for promoting the sustainability of this threatened ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The `pulse--reserve' conceptual model---arguably one of the most-cited paradigms in aridland ecology---depicts a simple, direct relationship between rainfall, which triggers pulses of plant growth, and reserves of carbon and energy. While the heuristics of `pulses', `triggers' and `reserves' are intuitive and thus appealing, the value of the paradigm is limited, both as a conceptual model of how pulsed water inputs are translated into primary production and as a framework for developing quantitative models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a revision of the pulse--reserve model that emphasizes the following: (1) what explicitly constitutes a biologically significant `rainfall pulse', (2) how do rainfall pulses translate into usable `soil moisture pulses', and (3) how are soil moisture pulses differentially utilized by various plant functional types (FTs) in terms of growth? We explore these questions using the patch arid lands simulation (PALS) model for sites in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Our analyses indicate that rainfall variability is best understood in terms of sequences of rainfall events that produce biologically-significant `pulses' of soil moisture recharge, as opposed to individual rain events. In the desert regions investigated, biologically significant pulses of soil moisture occur in either winter (October--March) or summer (July--September), as determined by the period of activity of the plant FTs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding specific growth responses to moisture pulses, because of the strong effects of and interactions between precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and plant FT responses, all of which vary among deserts and seasons. Our results further suggest that, in most soil types and in most seasons, there is little separation of soil water with depth. Thus, coexistence of plant FTs in a single patch as examined in this PALS study is likely to be fostered by factors that promote: (1) separation of water use over time (seasonal differences in growth), (2) relative differences in the utilization of water in the upper soil layers, or (3) separation in the responses of plant FTs as a function of preceding conditions, i.e., the physiological and morphological readiness of the plant for water-uptake and growth. Finally, the high seasonal and annual variability in soil water recharge and plant growth, which result from the complex interactions that occur as a result of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture conditions, nutrient availability, and plant FT composition and cover, call into question the use of simplified vegetation models in forecasting potential impacts of climate change in the arid zones in North America.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding is an important tool for understanding fungal communities. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA is the accepted fungal barcode but has known problems. The large subunit (LSU) rDNA has also been used to investigate fungal communities but available LSU metabarcoding primers were mostly designed to target Dikarya (Ascomycota + Basidiomycota) with little attention to early diverging fungi (EDF). However, evidence from multiple studies suggests that EDF comprise a large portion of unknown diversity in community sampling. Here we investigate how DNA marker choice and methodological biases impact recovery of EDF from environmental samples. We focused on one EDF lineage, Zoopagomycota, as an example. We evaluated three primer sets (ITS1F/ITS2, LROR/LR3, and LR3 paired with new primer LR22F) to amplify and sequence a Zoopagomycota mock community and a set of 146 environmental samples with Illumina MiSeq. We compared two taxonomy assignment methods and created an LSU reference database compatible with AMPtk software. The two taxonomy assignment methods recovered strikingly different communities of fungi and EDF. Target fragment length variation exacerbated PCR amplification biases and influenced downstream taxonomic assignments, but this effect was greater for EDF than Dikarya. To improve identification of LSU amplicons we performed phylogenetic reconstruction and illustrate the advantages of this critical tool for investigating identified and unidentified sequences. Our results suggest much of the EDF community may be missed or misidentified with ``standard'' metabarcoding approaches and modified techniques are needed to understand the role of these taxa in a broader ecological context.},

In this article, we present ecoPrimers, a software for identifying new barcode markers and their associated PCR primers. ecoPrimers scans whole genomes to find such markers without a priori knowledge. ecoPrimers optimizes two quality indices measuring taxonomical range and discrimination to select the most efficient markers from a set of reference sequences, according to specific experimental constraints such as marker length or specifically targeted taxa. The key step of the algorithm is the identification of conserved regions among reference sequences for anchoring primers. We propose an efficient algorithm based on data mining, that allows the analysis of huge sets of sequences. We evaluate the efficiency of ecoPrimers by running it on three different sequence sets: mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial genomes. Identified barcode markers correspond either to barcode regions already in use for plants or animals, or to new potential barcodes. Results from empirical experiments carried out on a promising new barcode for analyzing vertebrate diversity fully agree with expectations based on bioinformatics analysis. These tests demonstrate the efficiency of ecoPrimers for inferring new barcodes fitting with diverse experimental contexts. ecoPrimers is available as an open source project at: http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/trac/ecoPrimers.},

  abstract = {Summary It is a certainty that the tree of life can be broken up into large units of biodiversity that span such great evolutionary distances that one could call them kingdoms. However, if these units are to have any meaning, they must represent radiations of diverse groups underpinned by unique shared derived adaptations that drove the evolutionary success of each group. Without such evolutionary characters, these classifications are merely abstract concepts or arbitrarily demarcated lineages. Even the five kingdoms (commonly called plants, animals, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes) that gained popular acceptance from Whittaker (1) were abstractly defined and nonmonophyletic. These kingdoms were defined based on cellular organization (prokaryote or eukaryote), multicellularity (protist or ``higher'' eukaryote), and trophic level (producer [plants], consumer [animals], or decomposer [fungi]). Somewhat more phylogenetically sound definitions (2) have replaced these classifications, but the names, defining characters, and number of kingdoms are still not settled (e.g., 3 , 4).},

  abstract = {The taxonomic classification of DNA sequences has become a critical component of numerous ecological research applications; however, few studies have evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used sequence classification approaches. Further, the methods and software available for sequence classification are diverse, creating an environment in which it may be difficult to determine the best course of action and the trade-offs made using different classification approaches. Here, we provide an in silico evaluation of three DNA sequence classifiers, the rdp Na{\"i}ve Bayesian Classifier, rtax and utax. Further, we discuss the results, merits and limitations of both the classifiers and our method of classifier evaluation. Our methods of comparison are simple, yet robust, and will provide researchers a methodological and conceptual foundation for making such evaluations in a variety of research situations. Generally, we found a considerable trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity for the classifiers tested, indicating a need for further improvement of sequence classification tools.},

  abstract = {The species richness (diversity) of local plant and animal assemblages---biological communities---balances regional processes of species formation and geographic dispersal, which add species to communities, against processes of predation, competitive exclusion, adaptation, and stochastic variation, which may promote local extinction. During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory.},

  abstract = {In temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, nitrogen (N) limitation of tree metabolism is alleviated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. As forest soils age, the primary source of N in soil switches from inorganic (NH4+ and NO3-) to organic (mostly proteins). It has been hypothesized that ECM fungi adapt to the most common N source in their environment, which implies that fungi growing in older forests would have greater protein degradation abilities. Moreover, recent results for a model ECM fungal species suggest that organic N uptake requires a glucose supply. To test the generality of these hypotheses, we screened 55 strains of 13 Suillus species with different ecological preferences for their in vitro protein degradation abilities. Suillus species preferentially occurring in mature forests, where soil contains more organic matter, had significantly higher protease activity than those from young forests with low-organic-matter soils or species indifferent to forest age. Within species, the protease activities of ecotypes from soils with high or low soil organic N content did not differ significantly, suggesting resource partitioning between mineral and organic soil layers. The secreted protease mixtures were strongly dominated by aspartic peptidases. Glucose addition had variable effects on secreted protease activity; in some species, it triggered activity, but in others, activity was repressed at high concentrations. Collectively, our results indicate that protease activity, a key ectomycorrhizal functional trait, is positively related to environmental N source availability but is also influenced by additional factors, such as carbon availability.},

  abstract = {Amazonia is an environmentally heterogeneous and biologically megadiverse region, and its biodiversity varies considerably over space. However, existing knowledge on Amazonian biodiversity and its environmental determinants stems almost exclusively from studies of macroscopic above-ground organisms, notably vertebrates and trees. In contrast, diversity patterns of most other organisms remain elusive, although some of them, for instance microorganisms, constitute the overwhelming majority of taxa in any given location, both in terms of diversity and abundance. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to estimate prokaryote and eukaryote diversity in environmental soil and litter samples from 39 survey plots in a longitudinal transect across Brazilian Amazonia using 16S and 18S gene sequences, respectively. We characterize richness and community composition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and test their correlation with longitude and habitat. We find that prokaryote and eukaryote OTU richness and community composition differ significantly among localities and habitats, and that prokaryotes are more strongly structured by locality and habitat type than eukaryotes. Our results 1) provide a first large-scale mapping of Amazonian soil biodiversity, suggesting that OTU richness patterns might follow substantially different patterns from those observed for macro-organisms; and 2) indicate that locality and habitat factors interact in determining OTU richness patterns and community composition. This study shows the potential of DNA metabarcoding in unveiling Amazonia's outstanding diversity, despite the lack of complete reference sequence databases for the organisms sequenced.},

Because the vast majority of fungi capable of causing life-threatening infections target individuals with impaired immunity, recent decades have witnessed a stark rise in fungal infections due to medical interventions such as chemotherapy for cancer and immunosuppression for organ transplantation and due to the prevalence of HIV infection (1). Pathogenic fungi are the causative agents of billions of infections annually, with  1.5 million attributable mortalities (2). The public health burden is comparable to that observed with more notable infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, yet the impact of fungal infections on human health has been largely overlooked (3).},

Since January 2013, registration of fungal names is a mandatory requirement for valid publication under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN). This review explains the database innovations that have been implemented over the past few years, and discusses new features such as advanced queries, registration of typification events (MBT numbers for lecto, epi- and neotypes), the multi-lingual database interface, the nomenclature discussion forum, annotation system, and web services with links to third parties. MycoBank has also introduced novel identifcation services, linking DNAsequence data to numerous related databases to enable intelligent search queries. Although MycoBank flls an important void for taxon registration, challenges for the future remain to improve links between taxonomic names and DNA data, and to also introduce a formal system for naming fungi known from DNA sequence data only. To further improve the quality of MycoBank data, remote access will now allow registered mycologists to act as MycoBank curators, using Citrix software.},

This lack of knowledge stems from a lack of phylogenetic information and assumptions that microbial eukaryotes are globally distributed and have very limited diversity across vast geographic distances. However, these assumptions have been based more on assessments of their morphology than any measure of their true genetic diversity and biogeographic distribution. We developed specific primers for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of bdelloid rotifers and amplified and cloned sequences using a nested sampling scheme that represented local (0--10 m) to global (up to 10,000 km) scales. Using phylogenetic community analyses (UniFrac) and geospatial statistics (semivariograms, mantel tests), we were able to reject the hypothesis that communities of rotifers are the same across even fairly small geographic distances. Bdelloid communities showed highly significant spatial structuring with spatial autocorrelation ranges of 54--133 m, but beyond that distance communities were extremely dissimilar. Furthermore, we show that these spatial patterns are driven not only by changes in relative abundance of phylotypes but also by absolute changes in phylotype occurrence (richness). There is almost no overlap in phylotype [or operational taxonomic unit (OTU)] occurrence between communities at distances beyond the autocorrelation range ({\textasciitilde}133 m). Such small species ranges, combined with their ubiquity in soils, make it increasingly clear that the biodiversity of bdelloid rotifers (and other less easily dispersed microbes) is much higher than previously thought.},

In such systems we analysed the effects of water quality on biodiversity of several species groups, to determine tipping points and tools for monitoring. We investigated the water quality of 99 eutrophic and hypertrophic shallow lakes with extensive fish culture during a 3-year study, through the measures of physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton biomass and structure. In a second step, we related the water quality with richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates and dragonflies. With concentrations of chlorophyll-a above 30 or 70 {$\mu$}g l-1, shallow lakes are normally classified, respectively, in a poor or bad ecological state. However, our results show that chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 78 {$\mu$}g l-1 could be found together with relatively high species or family richness of aquatic plants, invertebrates and dragonflies. We identified most tipping points with 50--60 {$\mu$}g l-1 of chlorophyll-a, values above which a significant decrease of species diversity was found. For monitoring of these shallow lakes we propose to use chlorophyll-a concentrations in combination with water transparency during spring. These parameters are easily applicable and cheap and they yield a good forecast of the biodiversity for the species groups studied.},

We collected 1084 flies in 29 sampling days, conducted metabarcoding with mammal-specific (16S) and vertebrate-specific (12S) primers, and sequenced amplicons on Illumina MiSeq. For taxonomic assignment, we compared BLAST with the new program PROTAX, and we found that PROTAX improved species identifications. We detected 20 mammal, four bird, and one lizard species from carrion fly metabarcoding, all but one of which are known from BCI. Fly metabarcoding detected more mammal species than concurrent transect counts (29 sampling days, 13 species) and concurrent camera-trapping (84 sampling days, 17 species), and detected 67\% of the number of mammal species documented by eight years of transect counts and camera-trapping combined, although fly metabarcoding missed several abundant species. This study demonstrates that carrion fly metabarcoding is a powerful tool for mammal biodiversity surveys, and has the potential to detect a broader range of species than more commonly used methods.},

  abstract = {Conventional ecology lacks a non-contingent theory on the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors under natural or quasi-natural conditions. As a result, since ecology is the science that studies the interaction between ecological factors in nested complex systems, we should recognize that ecology needs significant enhancements to understand the functioning of ecosystems. This article combines the ecological state equation (ESE, one of the earliest models derived from the Organic Biophysics of Ecosystem --OBEC), with abundant field data of abiotic factors, biotic factors and human factors from inland water rotifers and crustaceans (1022 samples taken over 21 years), litter invertebrates in laurel forest and pine forest (308 samples), and marine interstitial meiofauna of sandy beaches (90 samples). This has been done in order to obtain additional empirical evidence on the intrinsic trend to stationarity in the long run, even in perturbed ecosystems (man-made eutrophic water reservoirs, forest vegetation affected by traffic, and coastal ecosystems close to disposal points of sewage that are fully or partially treated, respectively to the above-mentioned taxocenes), and the relationship between the above-mentioned ecological factors. Our results indicate that there is a complex natural arrangement that intertwines the trend to stationarity and the resilience capability of ecosystems with a clear pattern of hierarchical setup between ecological factors. This is reflected by the role of ESE as a trophodynamic interface in hierarchical statistical models (cluster analysis) because they involve, in the following order of increasing rank: lower level abiotic factors (a.f.), biotic factors (b.f.), the holistic combination of state variables included in the ESE and, finally, higher level human factors (h.f.). In such a way, there is a clear trend to a hierarchical assemblage in agreement with the evolutionary origin of ecological factors in the deep time, as well as in regard to the net direction ({$\longleftarrow$}) of ecological homeostasis: a.f. {$\longleftarrow$} b.f. {$\longleftarrow$} h.f. In this setup, the ESE accomplishes a key liaison role, because it reflects a long run trend to stationarity which allows an essential degree of ecological stability, as well as our capability to classify ecosystems, in spite of the random influence of ecological perturbations in the short run. The above-mentioned set of additional evidence can be regarded as a step to develop a non-contingent theory about the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. Furthermore, since the OBEC, in its origin, deals with only the dynamics of biotic variables, this is the first time that the interaction between one of its main models and other kind of ecological factors is studied yielding reliable results in the process.},

  abstract = {The initial components of ribosomes first appeared more than 3.8~billion years ago during a time when many types of RNAs were evolving. While modern ribosomes are complex molecular machines consisting of rRNAs and proteins, they were assembled during early evolution by the association and joining of small functional RNA units. Introns may have provided the means to ligate many of these pieces together. All four classes of introns (group I, group II, spliceosomal, and archaeal) are present in many rRNA gene loci over a broad phylogenetic range. A survey of rRNA intron sequences across the three major life domains suggests that some of the classes of introns may have diverged from one another within rRNA gene loci. Analyses of rRNA sequences revealed self-splicing group I and group II introns are present in ancestral regions of the SSU (small subunit) and LSU (large subunit), whereas spliceosomal and archaeal introns appeared in sections of the rRNA that evolved later. Most classes of introns increased in number for approximately 1~billion years. However, their frequencies are low in the most recently evolved regions added to the SSU and LSU rRNAs. Furthermore, many of the introns appear to have been in the same locations for billions of years, suggesting an ancient origin for these sequences. In this Perspectives paper, I reviewed and analyzed rRNA intron sequences, locations, structural characteristics, and splicing mechanisms; and suggest that rRNA gene loci may have served as evolutionary nurseries for intron formation and diversification.},

  abstract = {Background VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

  abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair- counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair- counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},

  abstract = {Efficient and accurate classification of DNA barcode data is crucial for large-scale fungal biodiversity studies. However, existing methods are either computationally expensive or lack accuracy. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of deep learning in this domain, successfully training neural networks for biological sequence classification. We introduce the MycoAI Python package, featuring various deep learning models such as BERT and CNN tailored for fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequences. We explore different neural architecture designs and encoding methods to identify optimal models. By employing a multi-head output architecture and multi-level hierarchical label smoothing, MycoAI effectively generalizes across the taxonomic hierarchy. Using over 5 million labelled sequences from the UNITE database, we develop two models: MycoAI-BERT and MycoAI-CNN. While we emphasize the necessity of verifying classification results by AI models due to insufficient reference data, MycoAI still exhibits substantial potential. When benchmarked against existing classifiers such as DNABarcoder and RDP on two independent test sets with labels present in the training dataset, MycoAI models demonstrate high accuracy at the genus and higher taxonomic levels, with MycoAI-CNN being the fastest and most accurate. In terms of efficiency, MycoAI models can classify over 300,000 sequences within 5 min. We publicly release the MycoAI models, enabling mycologists to classify their ITS barcode data efficiently. Additionally, MycoAI serves as a platform for developing further deep learning-based classification methods.

Prominent among ancient asexual lineages are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a group of plant symbionts with a multinucleate cytoplasm. Genomic divergence among co-existing nuclei was proposed to drive the evolutionary success of AMF in the absence of sex1, but this hypothesis has been contradicted by recent genome analyses that failed to find significant genetic diversity within an AMF isolate2,3. Here, we set out to resolve issues surrounding the genome organization and sexual potential of AMF by exploring the genomes of five isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis, a model AMF. We find that genetic diversity in this species varies among isolates and is structured in a homo-dikaryon-like manner usually linked with the existence of a sexual life cycle. We also identify a putative AMF mating-type locus, containing two genes with structural and evolutionary similarities with the mating-type locus of some Dikarya. Our analyses suggest that this locus may be multi-allelic and that AMF could be heterothallic and bipolar. These findings reconcile opposing views on the genome organization of these ubiquitous plant symbionts and open avenues for strain improvement and environmental application of these organisms.},

In this study, we (1) report the creation of a comprehensive reference library of DNA barcodes for the arthropods of an entire country (Finland), (2) publish this library, and (3) deliver a new identification tool for insects and spiders, as based on this resource. The reference library contains mtDNA COI barcodes for 11,275 (43\%) of 26,437 arthropod species known from Finland, including 10,811 (45\%) of 23,956 insect species. To quantify the improvement in identification accuracy enabled by the current reference library, we ran 1000 Finnish insect and spider species through the Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) identification engine. Of these, 91\% were correctly assigned to a unique species when compared to the new reference library alone, 85\% were correctly identified when compared to BOLD with the new material included, and 75\% with the new material excluded. To capitalize on this resource, we used the new reference material to train a probabilistic taxonomic assignment tool, FinPROTAX, scoring high success. For the full-length barcode region, the accuracy of taxonomic assignments at the level of classes, orders, families, subfamilies, tribes, genera, and species reached 99.9\%, 99.9\%, 99.8\%, 99.7\%, 99.4\%, 96.8\%, and 88.5\%, respectively. The FinBOL arthropod reference library and FinPROTAX are available through the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (www.laji.fi) at https://laji.fi/en/theme/protax. Overall, the FinBOL investment represents a massive capacity-transfer from the taxonomic community of Finland to all sectors of society.},

  abstract = {Estimates suggest that only one-tenth of the true fungal diversity has been described. Among numerous fungal lineages known only from environmental DNA sequences, Soil Clone Group 1 is the most ubiquitous. These globally distributed fungi may dominate below-ground fungal communities, but their placement in the fungal tree of life has been uncertain. Here, we report cultures of this group and describe the class, Archaeorhizomycetes, phylogenetically placed within subphylum Taphrinomycotina in the Ascomycota. Archaeorhizomycetes comprises hundreds of cryptically reproducing filamentous species that do not form recognizable mycorrhizal structures and have saprotrophic potential, yet are omnipresent in roots and rhizosphere soil and show ecosystem and host root habitat specificity. Cultivation and cloning allow phylogenetic placement of a prominent fungal lineage. Cultivation and cloning allow phylogenetic placement of a prominent fungal lineage.},

  abstract = {* Eutrophication remains a major stress for freshwater biodiversity. Its deleterious consequences on biodiversity are well documented for large waterbodies. However, the impact of eutrophication may differ in smaller waterbodies, such as ponds and small lakes, which generally support naturally high levels of nutrients in lowlands. Furthermore, this response could depend on the scale considered, from local (individual waterbody, alpha diversity) to regional (the network of waterbodies, gamma diversity). It is also unclear whether the richness of threatened species responds in the same way as the richness of the whole assemblage. * The present study investigates local- and regional-scale consequences of eutrophication on taxonomic richness (all taxa) and conservation value (threatened taxa) in temperate lowland small waterbodies. Five taxonomic groups were investigated: macrophytes, gastropods, water beetles, adult dragonflies and amphibians, in a set of natural waterbodies and a set of enriched waterbodies covering a large nutrient gradient from mesotrophic to hypertrophic conditions. * Globally, our study did not reveal consistent, systematic responses to eutrophication. For macrophytes, the richness and conservation value suffered from eutrophication at both local and regional scales. In contrast, for amphibians and gastropods, eutrophication did not impair biodiversity at the local nor the regional scale. Dragonflies and water beetles showed intermediate situations, with an impairment by eutrophication varying according to the type of waterbodies considered. At the regional scale, each trophic status, even the nutrient richest, brought an original contribution to biodiversity. * Synthesis and applications. The management of eutrophication for small lowland waterbodies has to be considered differently than for lakes. For an individual waterbody (the local scale), nutrient enrichment is not necessarily a major impairment and its impact depends on the taxonomic group considered. Conversely, at the landscape scale, eutrophication is a major pressure on small waterbody biodiversity, especially because nutrient-rich small waterbodies are dominant in the landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts should integrate the notion of pond regional networks or `pondscapes', where the regional biodiversity is supported by a mosaic of trophic conditions, and promote the presence of less rich waterbodies.},

  abstract = {With the recent changes concerning pleomorphic fungi in the new International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), it is necessary to propose the acceptance or protection of sexual morph-typified or asexual morph-typified generic names that do not have priority, or to propose the rejection or suppression1 of competing names. In addition, sexual morph-typified generic names, where widely used, must be proposed for rejection or suppression in favour of asexual morph-typified names that have priority, or the latter must be proposed for conservation or protection. Some pragmatic criteria used for deciding the acceptance or rejection of generic names include: the number of name changes required when one generic name is used over another, the clarity of the generic concept, their relative frequencies of use in the scientific literature, and a vote of interested mycologists. Here, twelve widely used generic names in three families of Hypocreales are proposed for acceptance, either by conservation or protection, despite their lack of priority of publication, or because they are widely used asexual morph-typified names. Each pair of generic names is evaluated, with a recommendation as to the generic name to be used, and safeguarded, either through conservation or protection. Four generic names typified by a species with a sexual morph as type that are younger than competing generic names typified by a species with an asexual morph type, are proposed for use. Eight older generic names typified by species with an asexual morph as type are proposed for use over younger competing generic names typified by a species with a sexual morph as type. Within Bionectriaceae, Clonostachys is recommended over Bionectria; in Hypocreaceae, Hypomyces is recommended over Cladobotryum, Sphaerostilbella over Gliocladium, and Trichoderma over Hypocrea; and in Nectriaceae, Actinostilbe is recommended over Lanatonectria, Cylindrocladiella over Nectricladiella, Fusarium over Gibberella, Gliocephalotrichum over Leuconectria, Gliocladiopsis over Glionectria, Nalanthamala over Rubrinectria, Nectria over Tubercularia, and Neonectria over Cylindrocarpon.},

The currently used approaches to RNA modeling are presented with a side view on the protein world, where many similar ideas have been used. Two main programs for automated template-based modeling are presented: ModeRNA assembling structures from fragments and MacroMoleculeBuilder performing a simulation to satisfy spatial restraints. Both approaches have in common that they require an alignment of the target sequence to a known RNA structure that is used as a modeling template. As a way to find promising template structures and to align the target and template sequences, we propose a pipeline combining the ParAlign and Infernal programs on RNA family data from Rfam. We also briefly summarize template-free methods for RNA 3D structure prediction. Typically, RNA structures generated by automated modeling methods require local or global optimization. Thus, we also discuss methods that can be used for local or global refinement of RNA structures.},

For the first time, the phylogenetic relationships of several African Termitomyces species was studied by the sequencing of their internal transcriber spacer region (ITS1--5.8S--ITS2). It appeared that this group is clearly monophyletic and belongs to the Tricholomataceae family. The total homology of the ITS zone of several Termitomyces symbionts of different termite genera indicated that the specific diversity of this group is in fact less important than previously supposed. Finally, the comparison between the Termitomyces phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic tree of Macrotermitinae showed that if for certain genera the hypothesis of termite/fungus coevolution is acceptable, it should not be applied for all symbiosis.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary transitions require the organization of genetic variation at two (or more) levels of selection so that fitness heritability may emerge at the new level. In this article, we consider the consequences for fitness variation and heritability of two of the main modes of reproduction used in multicellular organisms: vegetative reproduction and single-cell reproduction. We study a model where simple cell colonies reproduce by fragments or propagules of differing size, with mutations occurring during colony growth. Mutations are deleterious at the colony level but can be advantageous or deleterious at the cell level (``selfish'' or ``uniformly deleterious'' mutants). Fragment size affects fitness in two ways: through a direct effect on adult group size (which in turn affects fitness) and by affecting the within- and between-group variances and opportunity for selection on mutations at the two levels. We show that the evolution of fragment size is determined primarily by its direct effects on group size except when mutations are selfish. When mutations are selfish, smaller propagule size may be selected, including singlecell reproduction, even though smaller propagule size has a direct fitness cost by virtue of producing smaller organisms, that is, smaller adult cell groups.},

Although basic research on symbiotic ascomycetes lags behind that on symbiotic basidiomycetes, some progress has been made in the last few years on key questions concerning the biology and ecology of Tuber spp. In particular, the recent release of the T. melanosporum genome was a breakthrough that helped improve our understanding of the reproductive biology of this species. It also provided insight into the gene repertoires underlying the symbiotic relationship with host plants and the production of the distinctive truffle aroma. Genome mining has provided mycologists with a plethora of microsatellite markers that may be highly informative for population genetics studies. These recent advances in T. melanosporum research are discussed here in the context of fundamental research questions and the cultivation and marketing of truffle species.},

This SIMD set is currently supported by Intel's Knights Landing (KNL) accelerator and Intel's Skylake (SKL) general purpose processors. In this paper, we present an SW version that is optimized for both architectures: the renowned SWIMM 2.0. The novelty of this vector instruction set requires the revision of previous programming and optimization techniques. SWIMM 2.0 is based on a massive multi-threading and SIMD exploitation. It is competitive in terms of performance compared with other state-of-the-art implementations, reaching 511 GCUPS on a single KNL node and 734 GCUPS on a server equipped with a dual SKL processor. Moreover, these successful performance rates make SWIMM 2.0 the most efficient energy footprint implementation in this study achieving 2.94 GCUPS/Watts on the SKL processor.},

The intent of this collaborative effort is to provide a hierarchical classification serving not only the needs of the CoL's database providers but also the diverse public-domain user community, most of whom are familiar with the Linnaean conceptual system of ordering taxon relationships. This classification is neither phylogenetic nor evolutionary but instead represents a consensus view that accommodates taxonomic choices and practical compromises among diverse expert opinions, public usages, and conflicting evidence about the boundaries between taxa and the ranks of major taxa, including kingdoms. Certain key issues, some not fully resolved, are addressed in particular. Beyond its immediate use as a management tool for the CoL and ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), it is immediately valuable as a reference for taxonomic and biodiversity research, as a tool for societal communication, and as a classificatory ``backbone'' for biodiversity databases, museum collections, libraries, and textbooks. Such a modern comprehensive hierarchy has not previously existed at this level of specificity.},

  abstract = {Wild edible mushrooms have been collected and consumed by human groups for centuries, and today they represent a relevant source of food and income for many rural families worldwide. Preserving these non-timber forest products is of great interest, and there is concern about the damage caused by intensive mushroom harvesting on macromycete communities. The aim of this study was to evaluate variation in diversity and composition of macromycete species between areas regularly used for mushroom harvesting and non-harvested areas in the Mixteca region of Oaxaca, Mexico, as well as to assess the influence of microclimatic and environmental factors on this variation. We selected two harvested and two non-harvested sites within the study area. In each one, we established 10 permanent plots of 10 m {\texttimes} 10 m where we sampled all the observed fruit bodies weekly from June to October 2017. We recorded a total of 856 individuals corresponding to 138 species, and 23 of these were identified as edible. Overall macromycete diversity, edible species diversity and composition were similar in Sites 1 (non-harvested) and 3 (harvested), and in Sites 2 (non-harvested) and 4 (harvested). Variation of diversity and species composition along the studied area was mainly related to microclimatic variables, while most environmental variables and variables related to vegetation structure similarly affected macromycete species in the four sites. Our results indicate that intensive harvesting of wild edible mushrooms is not affecting the diversity and distribution of macromycete species in our study area. Knowledge on the sustainability of mushroom harvesting practices can help improve current regulations regarding the management of these valuable non-timber forest products.},

  abstract = {Molecular methods are increasingly used to identify species that lack conspicuous macro- or micromorphological characters. Taxonomic and ecological research teams barcode large numbers of collected voucher specimens annually. In this study we assessed the efficiency of long-read high throughput sequencing (HTS) as opposed to the traditionally used Sanger method for taxonomic identification of multiple vouchered fungal specimens. We also evaluated whether this method can provide reference information about intraindividual gene polymorphism. We developed a workflow based on a test set of 423 basidiomycete specimens (representing 195 species), the PacBio HTS method, and ribosomal rRNA operon internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA gene (LSU) markers. The PacBio HTS had a higher success rate than Sanger sequencing at a comparable cost. Species identification based on PacBio reads was usually straightforward, because the dominant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) typically represented the targeted organism. The PacBio HTS also enabled us to detect widespread polymorphism within the ITS marker. We conclude that multiplex DNA barcoding of the fungal ITS and LSU markers using PacBio HTS is a useful tool for taxonomic identification of large amounts of collected voucher specimens at a competitive price. Furthermore, PacBio HTS accurately recovers various alleles and paralogues, which can provide crucial information for species delimitation and population-level studies.},

All the morphological characters are correlated with the phylogeny, but we find spore shape and presence of cortina, to have the greatest taxonomic potential, as they are the most evolutionarily conserved. None of the five characters have, however, evolved in a way that easily delimits inclusive monophyletic groups and the section level taxonomy needs revision. Host preference, preference for calcareous soil, and soil nutritional status preference are shown to be reflective of the evolutionary history of the species at the scale investigated here while soil moisture preference is not. The states of three of the four ecological characters can therefore be predicted in a phylogenetic framework for species where they are unknown.},

ECM fungi include, though are not limited to, about 5000 described species of Agaricales from numerous, independently evolved lineages. Two central hypotheses suggest different explanations for the origin of ECM fungal diversity: (i) dual origins, initially with the Pinaceae in the Jurassic and later with angiosperms during the Late Cretaceous, and (ii) a simultaneous and convergent radiation of ECM lineages in response to cooling climate during the Palaeogene and advancing temperate ECM plant communities. Neither of these hypotheses is supported here. While we demonstrate support for asynchronous origins of ECM Agaricales, the timing of such events appears to have occurred more recently than suggested by the first hypothesis, first during the Cretaceous and later during the Palaeogene. We are also unable to reject models of rate constancy, which suggests that the diversity of ECM Agaricales is not a consequence of convergent rapid radiations following evolutionary transitions from saprotrophic to ECM habits. ECM lineages of Agaricales differ not only in age, but also in rates of diversification and rate of substitution at nuclear ribosomal RNA loci. These results question the biological uniformity of the ECM guild.},

  abstract = {During the last couple of decades, an increasing number of studies use sequence clusters as units for taxonomic diversity. It is well known that such molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) do not necessarily correspond to species, but they are treated as such when measuring diversity and testing theories. Here, I show that data from studies of molecular evolution and species diversification of fungi indicate that commonly used cut-offs are likely to lump species in many cases. At the same time, empirical studies show that the mean within-species variation is close to these cut-offs. That the within-species variation estimates are plausible is supported by coalescence modelling under a range of parameter settings. In addition, studies using crossing tests to delimit species show that there often is an overlap in within- and between-species distances. The available data therefore indicate that sequence clusters are likely to misrepresent species. However, to keep a biological relevance, MOTUs should be kept in close agreement with species. Studies using them should therefore asses how sensitive the results are to differences between MOTUs and species -- something that is rarely done. An even better solution is to directly include the uncertainty in species delimitation in the analyses, but in many cases, we need to increase our knowledge of taxonomy and evolution to do this accurately. Even if the empirical data referred to here pertain to the ``barcoding'' region of rDNA in fungi, there is nothing indicating that the situation is substantially better for other taxa or genes.},

  abstract = {Water conservation is important for plants that maintain physiologically active foliage during prolonged periods of drought. A variety of mechanisms for water conservation exist including stomatal regulation, foliage loss, above- and below-ground allocation patterns, size of xylem vessels and leaf pubescence. Using the results of a field and simulation study with Artemisia tridentata in the Great Basin, USA, we propose an additional mechanism of water conservation that can be used by plants in arid and semi-arid environments following pulses of water availability. Precipitation redistributed more uniformly in the soil column by roots (hydraulic redistribution of water downward) slows the rate at which this water can subsequently be taken up by plants, thus prolonging water availability during periods of drought. By spreading out water more uniformly in the soil column at lower water potentials following precipitation events, water use is reduced due to lower soil conductivity. The greater remaining soil water and more uniform distribution result in higher plant predawn water potentials and transpiration rates later in the drought period. Simulation results indicate that plants can benefit during drought periods from water storage following both summer rain events (small summer pulses) and overwinter recharge (large spring pulse). This mechanism of water conservation may aid in sustaining active foliage, maintaining root-soil hydraulic connectivity, and increasing survival probability of plants which remain physiologically active during periods of drought.},

  abstract = {Third-generation sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), have gained popularity over the last years. These platforms can generate millions of long-read sequences. This is not only advantageous for genome sequencing projects, but also advantageous for amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing experiments, such as DNA barcoding. However, the relatively high error rates associated with these technologies still pose challenges for generating high-quality consensus sequences. Here, we present NGSpeciesID, a program which can generate highly accurate consensus sequences from long-read amplicon sequencing technologies, including ONT and PacBio. The tool includes clustering of the reads to help filter out contaminants or reads with high error rates and employs polishing strategies specific to the appropriate sequencing platform. We show that NGSpeciesID produces consensus sequences with improved usability by minimizing preprocessing and software installation and scalability by enabling rapid processing of hundreds to thousands of samples, while maintaining similar consensus accuracy as current pipelines.},

  abstract = {Deadwood can be recreated as a forest restoration measure to increase the amount of deadwood and assist deadwood-dependent biodiversity. While deadwood restoration is known to have an overall positive effect on associated species in the long term, it remains poorly understood how and when wood-inhabiting organisms colonize different kinds of deadwood, which is essential for developing efficient restoration frameworks. In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding to compare wood-inhabiting fungal communities between fresh naturally fallen spruce logs and spruce logs felled for restoration. The results show that although pioneering fungal community composition greatly differs between natural and felled logs, with natural logs hosting more species-rich and heterogeneous communities, felled logs still hold a relatively high fungal diversity. Responses to log type carried a strong phylogenetic signal, and orders Polyporales and Hymenochaetales including most species of conservation concern were more likely to occur in natural than in felled logs. Furthermore, we found that log type was more important for rarely recorded than commonly recorded taxa, suggesting that rare species might be more specialized in their habitat requirements than the common ones. Overall, while restored deadwood can hold a high fungal diversity, the results underline that freshly felled logs do not mimic fresh natural logs. Deadwood restoration should focus not only on increasing the quantity of deadwood but also on the quality of thereof, and most importantly, retaining the existing natural deadwood rather than artificially downing trees.},

  abstract = {Mushroom-forming fungi (restricted to basidiomycetous fungi in this review) differentiate by sensing several environmental factors for fruiting body formation. For fruiting body induction, nutrient, temperature and light conditions are critical environmental factors. Higher nitrogen and carbon sources in the media will suppress fruiting body induction in many mushroom-forming fungi, with induction being triggered by lower nitrogen and carbon concentrations. Low temperature or temperature downshift is another critical influencing factor for fruiting body induction in many cultivated mushrooms, such as Flammulina velutipes, Lentinula edodes, and Volvariella volvacea. Fungal response toward starvation and cold involves the production of sexual spores as the next generation. Species like F. velutipes and Coprinopsis cinerea can form fruiting bodies in the dark; however, light accelerates fruiting body induction in some mushroom-forming fungi. Remarkably, fruiting bodies formed in the dark have tiny or no pileus on heads (called dark stipe, pinhead fruiting body, or etiolated stipe). Light is essential for pileus differentiation in many, but not all mushroom species; one exception is Agaricus bisporus. Mushrooms have positive phototropism and negative gravitropism for effective dispersal of spores. Carbon dioxide concentrations also affect fruiting body development; pileus differentiation is suppressed at a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Thus, the pileus differentiation system of mushrooms may allow the most effective diffusion of spores. Full expansion of the pileus is followed by pileus autolysis or senescence. In C. cinerea, pileus autolysis occurs during spore diffusion. Fruiting body senescence, browning of gill, and softening occur after harvesting in several mushroom species. Fruiting body induction, development, and maturation in mushroom-forming fungi are discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {Ribosomes are large, multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complexes, essential for protein synthesis. To meet the high cellular demand for ribosomes, all eukaryotes have numerous copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes that encode ribosomal RNA (rRNA), usually far in excess of the requirement for ribosome biogenesis. In all eukaryotes studied, rDNA genes are arranged in one or more clusters of tandem repeats localized to nucleoli. The tandem arrangement of repeats, combined with the high rates of transcription at the rDNA loci, and the difficulty of replicating repetitive sequences make the rDNA inherently unstable and particularly susceptible to large variations in repeat copy number. Despite mounting evidence suggesting extra-ribosomal functions of the rDNA, its repetitive nature has excluded it from traditional sequencing-based studies. However, more recently, several studies have revealed the unique potential of the rDNA to act as a ``canary in the coalmine,'' being particularly sensitive to genomic stresses and acting as a source of adaptive response. Here, we review evidence uncovering mechanisms of regulation of instability and copy number variation at the rDNA and their role in adaptation to the environment, which could serve to understand the basic principles governing the behavior of other tandem repeats and their role in shaping the genome.},

  abstract = {Aspergillus comprises a diverse group of species based on morphological, physiological and phylogenetic characters, which significantly impact biotechnology, food production, indoor environments and human health. Aspergillus was traditionally associated with nine teleomorph genera, but phylogenetic data suggest that together with genera such as Polypaecilum, Phialosimplex, Dichotomomyces and Cristaspora, Aspergillus forms a monophyletic clade closely related to Penicillium. Changes in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants resulted in the move to one name per species, meaning that a decision had to be made whether to keep Aspergillus as one big genus or to split it into several smaller genera. The International Commission of Penicillium and Aspergillus decided to keep Aspergillus instead of using smaller genera. In this paper, we present the arguments for this decision. We introduce new combinations for accepted species presently lacking an Aspergillus name and provide an updated accepted species list for the genus, now containing 339 species. To add to the scientific value of the list, we include information about living ex-type culture collection numbers and GenBank accession numbers for available representative ITS, calmodulin, {$\beta$}-tubulin and RPB2 sequences. In addition, we recommend a standard working technique for Aspergillus and propose calmodulin as a secondary identification marker.},

  abstract = {With {$\sim$}36,000 described species, Agaricomycetes are among the most successful groups of Fungi. Agaricomycetes display great diversity in fruiting body forms and nutritional modes. Most have pileate-stipitate fruiting bodies (with a cap and stalk), but the group also contains crust-like resupinate fungi, polypores, coral fungi, and gasteroid forms (e.g., puffballs and stinkhorns). Some Agaricomycetes enter into ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, while others are decayers (saprotrophs) or pathogens. We constructed a megaphylogeny of 8,400 species and used it to test the following five hypotheses regarding the evolution of morphological and ecological traits in Agaricomycetes and their impact on diversification: 1) resupinate forms are plesiomorphic, 2) pileate-stipitate forms promote diversification, 3) the evolution of gasteroid forms is irreversible, 4) the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis promotes diversification, and 5) the evolution of ECM symbiosis is irreversible. The ancestor of Agaricomycetes was a saprotroph with a resupinate fruiting body. There have been 462 transitions in the examined morphologies, including 123 origins of gasteroid forms. Reversals of gasteroid forms are highly unlikely but cannot be rejected. Pileate-stipitate forms are correlated with elevated diversification rates, suggesting that this morphological trait is a key to the success of Agaricomycetes. ECM symbioses have evolved 36 times in Agaricomycetes, with several transformations to parasitism. Across the entire 8,400-species phylogeny, diversification rates of ectomycorrhizal lineages are no greater than those of saprotrophic lineages. However, some ECM lineages have elevated diversification rates compared to their non-ECM sister clades, suggesting that the evolution of symbioses may act as a key innovation at local phylogenetic scales.},

Different from the majority of other intracellular membrane structures, mitochondria contain their own genetic materials that are capable of independent replication and inheritance. In this mini-review, we provide brief summaries of fungal mitochondrial genome structure, size, gene content, inheritance, and genetic variation. We pay special attention to the relative genetic polymorphisms of the mitochondrial vs nuclear genomes at the population level within individual fungal species. Among the 20 species/groups of species reviewed here, there is a range of variation among genes and species in the relative nuclear and mitochondrial genetic polymorphisms. Interestingly, most (15/20) showed a greater genetic diversity for nuclear genes and genomes than for mitochondrial genes and genomes, with the remaining five showing similar or slower nuclear genome genetic variations. This fungal pattern is different from the dominant pattern in animals, but more similar to that in plants. At present, the mechanisms for the variations among fungal species and the overall low level of mitochondrial sequence polymorphisms are not known. The increasing availability of population genomic data should help us reveal the potential genetic and ecological factors responsible for the observed variations.},

  abstract = {Assessment of bacterial diversity through sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes has been an approach widely used in environmental microbiology, particularly since the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. An additional innovation introduced by these technologies was the need of developing new strategies to manage and investigate the massive amount of sequencing data generated. This situation stimulated the rapid expansion of the field of bioinformatics with the release of new tools to be applied to the downstream analysis and interpretation of sequencing data mainly generated using Illumina technology. In recent years, a third generation of sequencing technologies has been developed and have been applied in parallel and complementarily to the former sequencing strategies. In particular, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced nanopore sequencing which has become very popular among molecular ecologists. Nanopore technology offers a low price, portability and fast sequencing throughput. This powerful technology has been recently tested for 16S rRNA analyses showing promising results. However, compared with previous technologies, there is a scarcity of bioinformatic tools and protocols designed specifically for the analysis of Nanopore 16S sequences. Due its notable characteristics, researchers have recently started performing assessments regarding the suitability MinION on 16S rRNA sequencing studies, and have obtained remarkable results. Here we present a review of the state-of-the-art of MinION technology applied to microbiome studies, the current possible application and main challenges for its use on 16S rRNA metabarcoding.},

  abstract = {Abstract Microbes are usually believed to have cosmopolitan distributions. However, for estimating the global distributions of microorganisms, discriminating among cryptic species and eliminating undersampling biases are important challenges. We used a novel approach to address these problems and infer the global distribution of a given fungal ecological guild. We collected mushroom-forming fungi from Yakushima, Japan. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) from these samples and queried their sequences against GenBank. After identifying similar sequences, we tracked down the geographical origins of samples that yielded those sequences. We used Bayesian zero-inflated models to allow for species whose DNA sequences have not yet been deposited in GenBank. Results indicated that the geographical distribution of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi was strongly constrained by host specificity, resulting in the occurrence of these fungi intensively in the neighbouring regions. On the other hand, saprotrophic (SAP) fungi were less constrained by climatic conditions, resulting in a much broader distribution range. We inferred that differences in constraints during colonization between ECM and SAP fungi were responsible for the different geographical distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the degree of host/habitat specificity and the degree of isolation of potentially suitable habitats determine microbial biogeographic patterns.},

  abstract = {We describe and illustrate two new species of Boletellus section Boletellus, B. aurocontextus sp. nov. and B. areolatus sp. nov., which are generally assumed to be B. emodensis. In this study, we reconstructed separate molecular phylogenetic trees of section Boletellus using the nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, the largest subunit (RPB1) and the second-largest subunit (RPB2) of nuclear RNA polymerase II gene and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 (cox3) gene. We also examined the morphologies of B. emodensis sensu lato (s.l.) and other related species for comparison. The molecular phylogenetic tree inferred from the sequences of nuclear DNA (ITS, and combined dataset of RPB1 and RPB2) indicated that three genetically and phylogenetically well-separated lineages were present within B. emodensis s.l. These three lineages were also distinguished on the basis of the molecular phylogenetic tree constructed using the sequences of mitochondrial DNA (cox3), suggesting distinct cytonuclear disequilibria (i.e., evidence of reproductive isolation) among these lineages. Therefore, these three lineages can be treated as independent species: B. aurocontextus, B. areolatus, and B. emodensis. Boletellus aurocontextus and B. areolatus are also distinct from B. emodensis by the macro- and microscopic morphologies. Boletellus aurocontextus is characterized by a pileus with bright yellow to lemon yellow context, which can be observed through a gap in the scales, and basidiospores with relatively large length (mean spore length, 21.4 {$\mu$}m; quotient of spore length and width, 2.51). In contrast, B. areolatus is characterized by a pileus with floccose to appressed thin scaly patches, a stipe with pallid or pale cream color at the upper half, and basidiospores with relatively small length (mean spore length, 16.5 {$\mu$}m; quotient of spore length and width, 1.80).},

  abstract = {Acquisition of mutualistic symbiosis could provide hosts and/or symbionts with novel ecological opportunities for evolutionary diversification. Such a mechanism is one of the major components of coevolutionary diversification. However, whether the origin of mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes diversification in fungi still requires clarification. Here, we aimed to reveal evolutionary diversification in a clade comprising ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Based on a phylogenic tree inferred from the sequences of 87 single-copy genes, we reconstructed the origins of ECM symbiosis in a species-rich basidiomycetous order, Boletales. High-resolution phylogeny of Boletales revealed that ECM symbiosis independently evolved from non-ECM states at least four times in the group. Among them, only the second most recent event, occurring in the clade of Boletaceae, was inferred to involve an almost synchronous rapid diversification and rapid transition from non-ECM to ECM symbiosis. Our results contradict the hypothesis of evolutionary priority effect, which postulates the greatest ecological opportunities in the oldest lineages. Therefore, the novel resources that had not been pre-empted by the old ECM fungal lineages -- supposedly the coevolving angiosperm hosts -- could be available for the young ECM fungal lineages, which resulted in evolutionary diversification occurring only in the young ECM fungal lineages.},

  abstract = {Summary In 1994, a paper signed by a single author based on genetic approaches opened a decisive breach leading to a dramatic expansion of our perception of the biological significance of the prion phenomenon (1). In the following years, biochemical reconstitution and transformation established that these biological entities, originally identified and defined in the context of mammalian diseases such as Kuru or Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, also exist in yeast as ``protein-based genes'' and correspond to previously described non-Mendelian genetic elements (2 , 3). It is now clear that in most known cases the physical basis for prion propagation is the formation, growth, and fragmentation of an amyloid aggregate. Amyloids are ordered protein polymers with a so-called cross-{$\beta$} structure (4). The original definition of prions as ``infectious proteinaceous particles'' is imprecise enough to still be operational today but as a consequence embraces a variety of biological phenomena and structural features (5). Defining prions thus remains a nontrivial task. While a more restrictive definition is perhaps neither possible nor desirable, this general term induces some confusion and controversy. In an attempt to clarify discourse, at some point investigators in the mammalian disease-related field denied the fungal ``infectious proteinaceous particles'' the name of prions and proposed instead to term them ``prionoids'' (6). These semantic battles should not be disregarded as sterile, but rather should be taken as an indication of the variety of the biological realities that the term covers.},

It builds upon previous tools to provide a flexible and powerful software package for analyzing sequencing data. As a case study, we used mothur to trim, screen, and align sequences; calculate distances; assign sequences to operational taxonomic units; and describe the {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} diversity of eight marine samples previously characterized by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. This analysis of more than 222,000 sequences was completed in less than 2 h with a laptop computer.},

  abstract = {In spite of technical advances that have provided increases in orders of magnitude in sequencing coverage, microbial ecologists still grapple with how to interpret the genetic diversity represented by the 16S rRNA gene. Two widely used approaches put sequences into bins based on either their similarity to reference sequences (i.e., phylotyping) or their similarity to other sequences in the community (i.e., operational taxonomic units [OTUs]). In the present study, we investigate three issues related to the interpretation and implementation of OTU-based methods. First, we confirm the conventional wisdom that it is impossible to create an accurate distance-based threshold for defining taxonomic levels and instead advocate for a consensus-based method of classifying OTUs. Second, using a taxonomic-independent approach, we show that the average neighbor clustering algorithm produces more robust OTUs than other hierarchical and heuristic clustering algorithms. Third, we demonstrate several steps to reduce the computational burden of forming OTUs without sacrificing the robustness of the OTU assignment. Finally, by blending these solutions, we propose a new heuristic that has a minimal effect on the robustness of OTUs and significantly reduces the necessary time and memory requirements. The ability to quickly and accurately assign sequences to OTUs and then obtain taxonomic information for those OTUs will greatly improve OTU-based analyses and overcome many of the challenges encountered with phylotype-based methods.},

  abstract = {Next generation metabarcoding is becoming an indispensable tool in fungal community ecology. Here we tested Illumina metabarcoding, a method that generates shorter reads but achieves deeper sequencing than 454 metabarcoding approaches. We found that paired-end Illumina MiSeq data cover the full ITS1 in many fungal lineages and are suitable for environmental fungal community assessment. There was substantial read loss during data cleanup (78.6\%), which, however, did not impede the analyses, because of the large number of initial sequences (over 4Mio). We observed a high stochasticity in individual PCR reactions. Comparing three repeated sets of PCRs products showed that 58.5\% of the total fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found were not recovered by any single set of PCR reactions. Similarly, comparing three annealing temperatures showed that 63.6\% of all fungal OTUs were not recovered using any single annealing temperature. These findings suggest that sampling of soil fungal communities is more exhaustive, if we combine repeated PCR products, and PCR products generated at various annealing temperatures. To analyze the above issues we sampled 16 soil cores along a 270~cm transect in a meadow. In total we recovered 3320 fungal OTUs (based on a 95\% similarity threshold). Distance decay analysis indicated that community similarity decreased slightly with geographical distance.},

Poor sample quality and contamination by exogenous DNA can make MIS challenging to use with modern genotyping-by-sequencing approaches, which have been traditionally developed for high-quality DNA sources. Given that MIS is often more appropriate in many contexts, there is a need to make such samples practical for harnessing MPS. Here, we test the ability for Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq), a multiplex amplicon sequencing approach, to effectively genotype minimally invasive cloacal DNA samples collected from the Western Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus), a threatened species in British Columbia, Canada. As there was no previous genetic information for this species, an optimized panel of 362 SNPs was selected for use with GT-seq from a de novo restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) assembly. Comparisons of genotypes generated within and among RADseq and GT-seq for the same individuals found low rates of genotyping error (GT-seq: 0.50\%; RADseq: 0.80\%) and discordance (2.57\%), the latter likely due to the different genotype calling models employed. GT-seq mean genotype discordance between blood and cloacal swab samples collected from the same individuals was also minimal (1.37\%). Estimates of population diversity parameters were similar across GT-seq and RADseq data sets, as were inferred patterns of population structure. Overall, GT-seq can be effectively applied to low-quality DNA samples, minimizing the inefficiencies presented by exogenous DNA typically found in minimally invasive samples and continuing the expansion of molecular ecology and conservation genetics in the genomics era.},

Hale Jr. as belonging in the genus Dictyonema (D. sericeum s.lat.) and possibly representing an undescribed species. The species is morphologically distinctive in forming densely woven, semicircular thalli, closely resembling those of the paleotropical D. liguuxtum but lacking clamps and with hyphal sheath around the photobiont filaments that resembles those of Cyphellostereum species. The species was reported to have hallucinogenic properties and chemical analyses suggest certain substances present that are shared with the hallucinogenic mushroom Psilocybe cubensis. Due to our inability to use pure reference compounds and scarce amount of sample for compound identification, however, our analyses were not able to determine conclusively the presence of hallucinogenic substances.},

Dissolved oxygen was lower, while specific conductivity and turbidity were higher in cattle-access wetlands. Mean biomass of detritus was lower in cattle-access wetlands compared to non-access wetlands; no differences were detected in algal biomass. * 4Given the negative impacts of cattle on water quality, detrital biomass, larval amphibian species richness and relative abundance of some amphibian species, we recommend that farmers consider excluding these livestock from aquatic environments.},

  abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

  abstract = {In arid/semi-arid ecosystems, biological resources, such as water, soil nutrients, and plant biomass, typically go through periods of high and low abundance. Short periods of high resource abundance are usually triggered by rainfall events, which, despite of the overall scarcity of rain, can saturate the resource demand of some biological processes for a time. This review develops the idea that there exists a hierarchy of soil moisture pulse events with a corresponding hierarchy of ecological responses, such that small pulses only trigger a small number of relatively minor ecological events, and larger pulses trigger a more inclusive set and some larger ecological events. This framework hinges on the observation that many biological state changes, where organisms transition from a state of lower to higher physiological activity, require a minimal triggering event size. Response thresholds are often determined by the ability of organisms to utilize soil moisture pulses of different infiltration depth or duration. For example, brief, shallow pulses can only affect surface dwelling organisms with fast response times and high tolerance for low resource levels, such as some species of the soil micro-fauna and -flora, while it takes more water and deeper infiltration to affect the physiology, growth or reproduction of higher plants. This review first discusses how precipitation, climate and site factors translate into soil moisture pulses of varying magnitude and duration. Next, the idea of the response hierarchy for ecosystem processes is developed, followed by an exploration of the possible evolutionary background for the existence of response thresholds to resource pulses. The review concludes with an outlook on global change: does the hierarchical view of precipitation effects in ecosystems provide new perspectives on the future of arid/semiarid lands?},

In this study, we demonstrate using real-time quantitative PCR analysis that the relative expression levels of a range of low- to high-abundance mRNAs are retained after SMART amplification independent of transcript abundance and full-length transcript, coding region and PCR product size. Using this technology, a mean amplification of 3800-fold was achieved in human liver samples, greatly enhancing the ability to perform replicate DNA array experiments. Probes generated with the SMART amplification method were used to detect increased expression of genes involved with inflammation, fibrosis, xenobiotic metabolism, immune function, oxidant stress and endothelium in liver from the baboon model of alcoholic liver disease.},

  abstract = {Understanding the structuring elements of soil food webs is a major challenge for ecologists. Given the complex nature of soil food webs, common treatment-based experiments and bivariate data analyses can only capture part of that complexity. Structural equation model (SEM) is a promising multivariate technique that may help understand direct and indirect relationships in complex soil food webs. As bacterial and fungal energy channels, as well as bottom--up and top--down forces operate simultaneously, we used SEM to explore the complex interactions among multiple trophic levels in soil food webs. Further, SEM allowed us to test established theory and to refine and derive hypotheses regarding the structuring forces of soil food webs. We studied detritus-based soil food webs in a 55-year-old subtropical Illicium verum forest ecosystem by sampling different important soil food web components, including main soil microbial groups, soil nematodes, and soil microarthropods. The SEM results confirmed established theory by showing the central role of the fungal energy channel, and bottom--up effects were more important for the structure of the food web than top--down forces in the studied subtropical forest soil. In addition, we could derive some novel and refined hypotheses regarding important feeding links in soil food webs. For instance, we provide hypotheses on feeding preferences of different groups of soil biota and on the strength of bottom--up versus top--down effects in forest soil food webs. Overall, we highlight that SEM provides a framework to understand complex interactions and energy pathways in soil food webs in a multivariate context, test established theory, and propose novel experimental tests.},

  abstract = {By altering the dynamics of DNA replication and repair, alternative ploidy states may experience different rates and types of new mutations, leading to divergent evolutionary outcomes. We report the first direct comparison of the genome-wide spectrum of spontaneous mutations arising in haploid and diploid forms of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Characterizing the number, types, locations, and effects of thousands of mutations revealed that haploids were more prone to single-nucleotide and mitochondrial mutations, while larger structural changes were more common in diploids. Mutations were more likely to be detrimental in diploids, even after accounting for the large impact of structural changes, contrary to the prediction that diploidy masks the effects of recessive alleles. Haploidy is expected to reduce the opportunity for conservative DNA repair involving homologous chromosomes, increasing the insertion-deletion rate, but we found little support for this idea. Instead, haploids were more susceptible to particular single-nucleotide mutations in late-replicating genomic regions, resulting in a ploidy difference in the spectrum of substitutions. In diploids we detect mutation rate variation among chromosomes in association with centromere location, a finding that is supported by published polymorphism data. Diploids are not simply doubled haploids; instead, our results predict that the spectrum of spontaneous mutations will substantially shape the dynamics of genome evolution in haploid and diploid populations.},

There are two conflicting views about the evolution of ECM in fungi suggesting (1) relatively few transitions to ECM followed by reversals to non-ECM, or (2) many independent origins of ECM and no reversals. In this study, we compare these, and other, hypotheses and test the impact of different models on inference. We assembled a dataset of five marker gene sequences (nuc58, nucLSU, nucSSU, rpb1, and rpb2) and 2,174 fungal taxa covering the three subphyla: Agaricomycotina, Mucoromycotina and Pezizomycotina. The fit of different models, including models with variable rates in clades or through time, to the pattern of ECM fungal taxa was tested in a Bayesian framework, and using AIC and simulations. We find that models implementing variable rates are a better fit than models without rate shift, and that the conclusion about the relative rate between ECM and non-ECM depend largely on whether rate shifts are allowed or not. We conclude that standard constant-rate ancestral state reconstruction models are not adequate for the analysis of the evolution of ECM fungi, and may give contradictory results to more extensive analyses.},

These protocols are suitable for small amounts of silica gel-preserved plant tissue such as are commonly available from endangered plants. The critical step to remove polysaccharides was performing initial washes in either STE (0.25 M sucrose, 0.03 M Tris, 0.05 M EDTA) or HEPES (2\% b-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\% PVP, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 8.0) buffer. Precipitating the DNA at room temperature with isopropanol also aided in decreasing polysaccharide co-precipitation.

  abstract = {Resource availability is often characterized by mean annual amounts, while ignoring the spatial variation within habitats and the temporal variation within a year. Yet, temporal and spatial variation may be especially important for identifying the source of stress in low productivity environments such as deserts where resources are often pulsed and resource renewal events are separated by long periods of low resource availability. Therefore, the degree of stress will be determined in part by the length of time between recharge events. Here, we investigated the effect of timing and total amount of water application on two congeneric pairs, each with a population from a low (desert) and a high (Mediterranean) productivity habitat. As expected, highest survival and greatest growth were found at low or intermediate recharge intervals, and the magnitude of response to increases in total seasonal amounts was greater for Mediterranean species than desert species. The species that had greater survival switched in the hierarchy under high total water depending on interval length. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in resource availability can be as important as annual total amounts for plant performance and that response to temporal dynamics can vary between species. This has implications for community-level processes, as competitive hierarchies may switch based on resource dynamics rather than only total availability.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of the genera Russula and Lactarius were investigated using sequence data from the nuclear-encoded large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA). Ninety-five sequences belonging to the genera Russula and Lactarius, including 31 sequences from the databases, were used in this study. Analysis of the LSU rDNA region indicated that Russulaceae was divided into six groups (group A--F) in the neighbor-joining (NJ) tree. Lactarius consisted of one large clade (group A). Therefore, this genus was found to be monophyletic. However, the monophyly of genus Russula remained unclear. The genus Russula consisted of five groups in the NJ tree. Group B includes sects. Plorantes and Archaeinae (Heim), and group C includes sects. Delicoarchaeae and Russula in the NJ tree. Neither of the two groups formed a single clade in the most parsimonius (MP) tree. Group D includes many taxa having colored spore prints and amyloid in suprahilar plage of spores in sect. Russula and sect. Rigidae. Group E consists of only sect. Compactae and is further divided into three subclades, represented by R. densifolia, R. nigricans, and R. subnigricans, respectively. Group F contains sects. Rigidae, Ingratae, and Pelliculariae. Sect. Compactae and sect. Plorantes should not be as closely related as previously supposed. Russula earlei may be placed in sect. Archaeinae Heim. Russula flavida (subsect. Amoeninae) is placed in sect. Russula with R. aurea with a high bootstrap value (99\%). The nuclear LSU rDNA region is a useful tool in recognization of species of Russulaceae and may provide information concerning phylogenetic relationships between the genera Russula and Lactarius.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models usually attempt to explain presence-absence or abundance of a species at a site in terms of the environmental features (socalled abiotic features) present at the site. Historically, such models have considered species individually. However, it is well-established that species interact to influence presence-absence and abundance (envisioned as biotic factors). As a result, there has been substantial recent interest in joint species distribution models with various types of response, e.g., presence-absence, continuous and ordinal data. Such models incorporate dependence between species response as a surrogate for interaction. The challenge we focus on here is how to address such modeling in the context of a large number of species (e.g., order 102) across sites numbering in the order of 102 or 103 when, in practice, only a few species are found at any observed site. Again, there is some recent literature to address this; we adopt a dimension reduction approach. The novel wrinkle we add here is spatial dependence. That is, we have a collection of sites over a relatively small spatial region so it is anticipated that species distribution at a given site would be similar to that at a nearby site. Specifically, we handle dimension reduction through Dirichlet processes joined with spatial dependence through Gaussian processes. We use both simulated data and a plant communities dataset for the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa to demonstrate our approach. The latter consists of presence-absence measurements for 639 tree species on 662 locations. Through both data examples we are able to demonstrate improved predictive performance using the foregoing specification.},

However, the sequence data used for these phylogenetic estimations have been limited to the nrDNA of ca., 50 taxa, and the relationships among higher taxonomic groups are not well understood. To provide a phylogenetic overview of Erysiphaceae, we performed phylogenetic estimations based on nrDNA and MCM7 sequences obtained from ca., 270 taxa. The phylogenetic tree showed a similar topology to the trees obtained in previous studies, although the branching order between Golovinomyceteae and Phyllactinieae was different and Phyllactinieae was not monophyletic. Phyllactinieae and Erysipheae were estimated to diversify after the divergence of Golovinomyceteae, suggesting an evolutionary trend in which non-catenate conidia~+~endoparasitic or non-catenate conidia~+~ectoparasitic lineages were derived from catenate conidia~+~ectoparasitic lineages. Phyllactinieae was divided into a clade of Phyllactinia~+~Leveillula and other clade(s) consisting of Pleochaeta and Queirozia. The phylogenetic hypothesis of Erysiphaceae was updated based on the largest dataset to date, but the higher-level phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. For a more robust phylogenetic hypothesis of Erysiphaceae, further sequence data, including protein coding regions, should be added to the dataset of nrDNA sequences.},

The analysis of environmental DNA through the use of specific gene markers such as species-specific DNA barcodes has been a key application of next-generation sequencing technologies in ecological and environmental research. Access to parallel, massive amounts of sequencing data, as well as subsequent improvements in read length and throughput of different sequencing platforms, is leading to a better representation of sample diversity at a reasonable cost. New technologies are being developed rapidly and have the potential to dramatically accelerate ecological and environmental research. The fast pace of development and improvements in next-generation sequencing technologies can reflect on broader and more robust applications in environmental DNA research. Here, we review the advantages and limitations of current next-generation sequencing technologies in regard to their application for environmental DNA analysis.},

  abstract = {DNA barcoding is an efficient method to identify specimens and to detect undescribed/cryptic species. Sanger sequencing of individual specimens is the standard approach in generating large-scale DNA barcode libraries and identifying unknowns. However, the Sanger sequencing technology is, in some respects, inferior to next-generation sequencers, which are capable of producing millions of sequence reads simultaneously. Additionally, direct Sanger sequencing of DNA barcode amplicons, as practiced in most DNA barcoding procedures, is hampered by the need for relatively high-target amplicon yield, coamplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, confusion with sequences from intracellular endosymbiotic bacteria (e.g. Wolbachia) and instances of intraindividual variability (i.e. heteroplasmy). Any of these situations can lead to failed Sanger sequencing attempts or ambiguity of the generated DNA barcodes. Here, we demonstrate the potential application of next-generation sequencing platforms for parallel acquisition of DNA barcode sequences from hundreds of specimens simultaneously. To facilitate retrieval of sequences obtained from individual specimens, we tag individual specimens during PCR amplification using unique 10-mer oligonucleotides attached to DNA barcoding PCR primers. We employ 454 pyrosequencing to recover full-length DNA barcodes of 190 specimens using 12.5\% capacity of a 454 sequencing run (i.e. two lanes of a 16 lane run). We obtained an average of 143 sequence reads for each individual specimen. The sequences produced are fulllength DNA barcodes for all but one of the included specimens. In a subset of samples, we also detected Wolbachia, nontarget species, and heteroplasmic sequences. Next-generation sequencing is of great value because of its protocol simplicity, greatly reduced cost per barcode read, faster throughout and added information content.},

  abstract = {Carbon (C), nutrients and water (H2O) have been known for five decades to flow between plants through ectomycorrhizal (EM) networks. This flux has the potential to affect plant and fungal performance and resource distribution within communities. We asked two questions: (1) What are the pathways and mechanisms for C, nutrient and H2O fluxes between plants through EM networks? (2) What are the magnitude, fate and importance of C, nutrient and H2O transfer among EM plants? Mycorrhizal networks provide a distinct pathway for resource fluxes among plants and mycorrhizal fungi, partitioning them away from other competing soil microbes and plant roots in the soil matrix, and potentially providing a competitive advantage (or disadvantage) for some individuals involved in the network. Carbon and nutrients flow symplastically and apoplastically through mycorrhizal symbionts, hyphae and rhizomorphs along source-sink gradients across the networking mycelia and plant community. EM networks can also facilitate the hydraulic redistribution of soil or plant water following water potential gradients. Carbon fluxes through EM networks have been shown to supply 0--10 \% of autotrophic, up to 85 \% of partial myco-heterotrophic (MH), and 100 \% of fully MH plant C. This C supply has been loosely associated with the increased survival and growth of autotrophic plants, but has been shown to be essential for the survival of MH plants. Network-mediated nitrogen (N) fluxes between N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing plants have supplied up to 40 \% of receiver N, and this has been associated with increased plant productivity. Fluxes between non-N2-fixing plants have supplied {$<$}5 \% of receiver N. Hydraulic redistribution involving EM fungi has supplied up to 50 \% of plant water; this has been shown as essential for plant survival in some cases. However, uncertainty remains as to how much of this water transfers through EM networks. Phosphorus transfer through EM networks has not been adequately demonstrated. Overall, this review chapter shows that resource fluxes though EM networks are sufficiently large in some cases to facilitate plant establishment and growth. Resource fluxes through EM networks may thus serve as a method for interactions and cross-scale feedbacks in the development of plant-microbial communities. The outcome of resource transfer through EM networks for the stability of terrestrial ecosystems depends upon the environmental context.},

We also give the results of two applications and compare EIV values related to the Red List classification with those related to lifestyle classification. Mycorrhizal species on average have higher demands on substrate openness and are less tolerant of high nutrient levels than saprotrophic or parasitic species. Critically endangered species have on average distinctly higher demands on openness of habitat and substrate than not threatened or less strongly threatened species, which in turn have higher demands for nutrient availability.

To investigate their spread, we studied ribosomal (r)DNA introns from the closely related lichens Physcia aipolia and P. stellaris. Both taxa are replete with rDNA spliceosomal introns and autocatalytic group I introns, many of which show presence/absence polymorphism when screened with the PCR approach. This initially suggested that Physcia could be a model for studying intron retention and loss. However, during the course of a population-level analysis, we discovered widespread intron presence/absence heterogeneity within lichen thalli. To address this result, we sequenced multiple clones encoding nuclear rDNA and the single-copy elongation factor-1{$\alpha$} (EF-1{$\alpha$}) from individual thalli. These data showed extensive rDNA heterogeneity within individuals, rather than the presence of multiple fungi within a thallus. Our results suggest that considerable care must be taken when interpreting intron presence/absence in lichen rDNA, an observation that has general implications for the study of rDNA intron evolution.},

  abstract = {Macrophyte biomass production and species richness were monitored from 1988 through 1991 in four freshwater wetlands constructed on the floodpain of the Des Plaines River, Lake County, Illinois, USA. The wetlands were constructed in 1988 and pumping of river water began in 1989 under two differentd hydrologic regimes: two wetlands received high water inflow (equivalent to 40 cm wk-1 of water depth) and two received low flow (11 cm wk-1). Biomass production showed no relationship to the hydrologic inflows after two years of experimentation, with both the highest and lowest production occuring in low flow wetlands. Rates of primary production increased between 1990 and 1991 under low flow conditions and decreased under high flow conditions, primarily as a result of the initial composition of the plant community. The change from dry conditions in 1988 to flooded conditions in 1989 altered the species composition in each wetland to include almost 100\% wetland-adapted species. Similarity in species composition among the four wetlands diverged from 1988 to 1989 as the plant community adjusted to flooded conditions and then converged in both 1990 and 1991 as the wetlands developed.},

  abstract = {The utilization, preservation, and trade of fungal fruiting bodies for food purposes trace far back in the history of mankind. Hundreds of edible ectomycorrhizal mushroom (EEMM) species are known to be eaten in the world, and records are sparse for many regions, particularly in Africa and South America. A few species have well-established worldwide markets in excess of US\$2 billion, while many other species are important at a local scale. In this chapter, the international trade of fresh and preserved EEMMs for most important species with higher prices and/or a significant market share is analyzed in detail. Common techniques for mushroom preservation, e.g., drying, freezing, brining (i.e., preservation in brine), are also reviewed. Problems with the correct mycological determination of traded fungal species are examined, including issues of contrasting evaluation of edibility, both in mushroom field guides (some recommend eating species that others reject as poisonous), and in regulations of different countries. Finally, regulations in international EEMMs trade are discussed in relation to food safety and quality control of fresh and preserved EEMMs (radioactivity, heavy metals, nicotine and pesticide residues, presence of dipteran larvae and other ``parasites'').},

  abstract = {Among the many interactions between fungi and insects, mycophagy has definitely the greatest impact on the commerce and human food consumption of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms (EEMMs). Arthropods belonging to different classes and especially to certain orders of insects feed on macromycetes, in particular on the fruiting bodies of many Aphyllophorales, which can persist in the environment for several months or years and are associated with a wider range of insect fauna. This study examines fungus--insect relationships with a focus on the interactions that are responsible for the presence of parasites in the EEMM designed for human consumption. Since many fungicolous arthropods are not strictly fungivorous, in addition to mycophagy, we also examine predation, cannibalism, and parasitism. The treatise of the principal taxa of parasite arthropods in EEMM, mainly insects belonging to the order Diptera and Coleoptera, is followed by a list of the commercially most important EEMM examined in relation to their propensity to be attacked by arthropods. After analyzing the behaviour of fungivorous arthropods during the various procedures of mushroom preservation (drying, freezing, brining, cooking), this study takes into consideration the entomofauna that lives in dried mushrooms (post-drying infestations). The final considerations are about the two methodological approaches for the evaluation of insect contamination in EEMM destined for human consumption (fresh, dried, or otherwise preserved): the macroscopic mushroom analysis and the parasitological analysis under stereomicroscope.},

Divide-and-conquer is a useful approach that has been shown to improve the scalability and accuracy of MSA estimation in established methods such as SAT{\'e} and PASTA. In these divide-and-conquer strategies, a sequence dataset is divided into disjoint subsets, alignments are computed on the subsets using base MSA methods (e.g. MAFFT), and then merged together into an alignment on the full dataset.We present MAGUS, Multiple sequence Alignment using Graph clUStering, a new technique for computing large-scale alignments. MAGUS is similar to PASTA in that it uses nearly the same initial steps (starting tree, similar decomposition strategy, and MAFFT to compute subset alignments), but then merges the subset alignments using the Graph Clustering Merger, a new method for combining disjoint alignments that we present in this study. Our study, on a heterogeneous collection of biological and simulated datasets, shows that MAGUS produces improved accuracy and is faster than PASTA on large datasets, and matches it on smaller datasets.MAGUS: https://github.com/vlasmirnov/MAGUSSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We demonstrate how DNA barcoding helps address the failure of current inventory methods to rapidly respond to pressing biodiversity needs, specifically in the assessment of richness and turnover across landscapes with hyperdiverse taxa. In a comparison of inventories at four localities in northern Madagascar, patterns of richness were not significantly different when richness was determined using morphological taxonomy (morphospecies) or sequence divergence thresholds (Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit(s); MOTU). However, sequence-based methods tended to yield greater richness and significantly lower indices of similarity than morphological taxonomy. MOTU determined using our molecular technique were a remarkably local phenomenon---indicative of highly restricted dispersal and/or long-term isolation. In cases where molecular and morphological methods differed in their assignment of individuals to categories, the morphological estimate was always more conservative than the molecular estimate. In those cases where morphospecies descriptions collapsed distinct molecular groups, sequence divergences of 16\% (on average) were contained within the same morphospecies. Such high divergences highlight taxa for further detailed genetic, morphological, life history, and behavioral studies.},

Although the specific number of species is not currently known, it is clear that the vast majority of species and lineages of edible EM fungi are solely harvested from natural habitats. Many attempts have been made to cultivate EEMM. However, most successful attempts to cultivate EEMM involve species characterized by sequestrate (truffle-like) fruiting bodies, perhaps owing to the propensity of sequestrate fungi to initiate ectomycorrhizas from spores as well as other ecological preadaptations as pioneer species. Given the functional and biological differences between species of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, including key mating and life history traits, management strategies will differ between lineages and species. Nature provides the genetic resources for both cultivated and wild-collected species, so policies that conserve the natural habitats where these fungi grow and reproduce are critical to future yields of EEMM.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular approaches and DNA sequencing have greatly progressed the field of ecology and allowed for the study of complex communities in unprecedented detail. Next generation sequencing (NGS) can reveal powerful insights into the diversity, composition, and dynamics of cryptic organisms, but results may be sensitive to a number of technical factors, including molecular practices used to generate amplicons, sequencing technology, and data processing. Despite the popularity of some techniques over others, explicit tests of the relative benefits they convey in molecular ecology studies remain scarce. Here we tested the effects of PCR replication, sequencing depth, and sequencing platform on ecological inference drawn from environmental samples of soil fungi. We sequenced replicates of three soil samples taken from pine biomes in North America represented by pools of either one, two, four, eight, or sixteen PCR replicates with both 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq. Increasing the number of pooled PCR replicates had no detectable effect on measures of {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity. Pseudo-{$\beta$}-diversity -- which we define as dissimilarity between re-sequenced replicates of the same sample -- decreased markedly with increasing sampling depth. The total richness recovered with Illumina was significantly higher than with 454, but measures of {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-diversity between a larger set of fungal samples sequenced on both platforms were highly correlated. Our results suggest that molecular ecology studies will benefit more from investing in robust sequencing technologies than from replicating PCRs. This study also demonstrates the potential for continuous integration of older datasets with newer technology.},

It performs numerous essential functions during translation, including formation of the initiation complex and proofreading of base-pairs between mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons. The core constituent of the small ribosomal subunit is a {\textasciitilde}1.5 kb RNA strand in prokaryotes (16S rRNA) and a homologous {\textasciitilde}1.8 kb RNA strand in eukaryotes (18S rRNA). Traditional sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) of rRNA genes or rRNA cDNA copies has achieved wide use as a `molecular chronometer' for phylogenetic studies, and as a tool for identifying infectious organisms in the clinic. However, epigenetic modifications on rRNA are erased by SBS methods. Here we describe direct MinION nanopore sequencing of individual, full-length 16S rRNA absent reverse transcription or amplification. As little as 5 picograms ({\textasciitilde}10 attomole) of purified E. coli 16S rRNA was detected in 4.5 micrograms of total human RNA. Nanopore ionic current traces that deviated from canonical patterns revealed conserved E. coli 16S rRNA 7-methylguanosine and pseudouridine modifications, and a 7-methylguanosine modification that confers aminoglycoside resistance to some pathological E. coli strains.},

  abstract = {Plant species and functionally related species groups from arid and semi-arid habitats vary in their capacity to take up summer precipitation, acquire nitrogen quickly after summer precipitation, and subsequently respond with ecophysiological changes (e.g. water and nitrogen relations, gas exchange). For species that respond ecophysiologically, the use of summer precipitation is generally assumed to affect long-term plant growth and thus alter competitive interactions that structure plant communities and determine potential responses to climate change. We assessed ecophysiological and growth responses to large short-term irrigation pulses over one to three growing seasons for several widespread Great Basin and northern Mojave Desert shrub species: Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Atriplex confertifolia, and A. parryi. We compared control and watered plants in nine case studies that encompassed adults of all four species, juveniles for three of the species, and two sites for two of the species. In every comparison, plants used summer water pulses to improve plant water status or increase rates of functioning as indicated by other ecophysiological characters. Species and life history stage responses of ecophysiological parameters (leaf N, {$\delta$}15N, {$\delta$}13C, gas exchange, sap flow) were consistent with several previous short-term studies. However, use of summer water pulses did not affect canopy growth in eight out of nine comparisons, despite the range of species, growth stages, and site conditions. Summer water pulses affected canopy growth only for C. nauseosus adults. The general lack of growth effects for these species might be due to close proximity of groundwater at these sites, co-limitation by nutrients, or inability to respond due to phenological canalization. An understanding of the connections between short-term ecophysiological responses and growth, for different habitats and species, is critical for determining the significance of summer precipitation for desert community dynamics.},

  abstract = {On 15 April 2020, space-based gamma ray detectors recorded one of the most elusive events in astronomy---a giant flare erupting from a magnetar, a highly magnetized neutron star, in a neighboring galaxy. Over previous decades only three magnetar giant flares have been confirmed, and the road to understanding them has paralleled the study of magnetars themselves. In 1979, the first giant flare arrived at the dawn of gamma ray astronomy. U.S., European, and Soviet teams, in a rare case of Cold War--era collaboration, recognized it was from a source unknown to science. But it wasn't until 1992 that scientists postulated a possible cause: a starquake rearranging the surface of a neutron star 1 trillion times more magnetized than a refrigerator magnet. Since then, magnetars have been invoked again and again as the possible engine behind several types of unexplained astrophysical explosions. The 2020 giant flare, studied in greater detail than ever before, supports several aspects of the starquake model---and suggests both magnetars and their rare quakes are still common enough to be linked to many other transient events seen in the more distant universe. Nature's most magnetic objects, ripped apart in starquakes, can unleash powerful flashes of light. Nature's most magnetic objects, ripped apart in starquakes, can unleash powerful flashes of light.},

  abstract = {Summary Increased CO2 emissions and global warming may alter the composition of fungal communities through the removal of temperature limitation in the plant--soil system, faster nitrogen (N) cycling and changes in the carbon (C) allocation of host plants to the rhizosphere. At a Swiss treeline featuring Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata, the effects of multiple years of CO2 enrichment and experimental soil warming on the fungal community composition in the organic horizons were analysed using 454-pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons. Sporocarp production and colonization of ectomycorrhizal root tips were investigated in parallel. Fungal community composition was significantly altered by soil warming, whereas CO2 enrichment had little effect. Tree species influenced fungal community composition and the magnitude of the warming responses. The abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa was positively correlated with N availability, and ectomycorrhizal taxa specialized for conditions of high N availability proliferated with warming, corresponding to considerable increases in inorganic N in warmed soils. Traits related to N utilization are important in determining the responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi to warming in N-poor cold ecosystems. Shifts in the overall fungal community composition in response to higher temperatures may alter fungal-driven processes with potential feedbacks on ecosystem N cycling and C storage at the alpine treeline.},

Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.},

  abstract = {A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800--130 000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15--100\% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible.},

  abstract = {Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) are nonfunctional copies of mtDNA in the nucleus that have been found in major clades of eukaryotic organisms. They can be easily coamplified with orthologous mtDNA by using conserved universal primers; however, this is especially problematic for DNA barcoding, which attempts to characterize all living organisms by using a short fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Here, we study the effect of numts on DNA barcoding based on phylogenetic and barcoding analyses of numt and mtDNA sequences in two divergent lineages of arthropods: grasshoppers and crayfish. Single individuals from both organisms have numts of the COI gene, many of which are highly divergent from orthologous mtDNA sequences, and DNA barcoding analysis incorrectly overestimates the number of unique species based on the standard metric of 3\% sequence divergence. Removal of numts based on a careful examination of sequence characteristics, including indels, in-frame stop codons, and nucleotide composition, drastically reduces the incorrect inferences of the number of unique species, but even such rigorous quality control measures fail to identify certain numts. We also show that the distribution of numts is lineage-specific and the presence of numts cannot be known a priori. Whereas DNA barcoding strives for rapid and inexpensive generation of molecular species tags, we demonstrate that the presence of COI numts makes this goal difficult to achieve when numts are prevalent and can introduce serious ambiguity into DNA barcoding.},

  abstract = {Background Internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) is already one of the most popular phylogenetic and DNA barcoding markers. However, the existence of its multiple copies has complicated such usage and a detailed characterization of intra-genomic variations is critical to address such concerns. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we used sequence-tagged pyrosequencing and genome-wide analyses to characterize intra-genomic variations of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions from 178 plant species. We discovered that mutation of ITS2 is frequent, with a mean of 35 variants per species. And on average, three of the most abundant variants make up 91\% of all ITS2 copies. Moreover, we found different congeneric species share identical variants in 13 genera. Interestingly, different species across different genera also share identical variants. In particular, one minor variant of ITS2 in Eleutherococcus giraldii was found identical to the ITS2 major variant of Panax ginseng, both from Araliaceae family. In addition, DNA barcoding gap analysis showed that the intra-genomic distances were markedly smaller than those of the intra-specific or inter-specific variants. When each of 5543 variants were examined for its species discrimination efficiency, a 97\% success rate was obtained at the species level. Conclusions Identification of identical ITS2 variants across intra-generic or inter-generic species revealed complex species evolutionary history, possibly, horizontal gene transfer and ancestral hybridization. Although intra-genomic multiple variants are frequently found within each genome, the usage of the major variants alone is sufficient for phylogeny construction and species determination in most cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of minor variants further improves the resolution of species identification.},

  abstract = {Next generation fungal amplicon sequencing is being used with increasing frequency to study fungal diversity in various ecosystems; however, the influence of sample preparation on the characterization of fungal community is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of four procedural modifications to library preparation for high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The following treatments were considered: 1) the amount of soil used in DNA extraction, 2) the inclusion of additional steps (freeze/thaw cycles, sonication, or hot water bath incubation) in the extraction procedure, 3) the amount of DNA template used in PCR, and 4) the effect of sample pooling, either physically or computationally. Soils from two different ecosystems in Minnesota, USA, one prairie and one forest site, were used to assess the generality of our results. The first three treatments did not significantly influence observed fungal OTU richness or community structure at either site. Physical pooling captured more OTU richness compared to individual samples, but total OTU richness at each site was highest when individual samples were computationally combined. We conclude that standard extraction kit protocols are well optimized for fungal HTS surveys, but because sample pooling can significantly influence OTU richness estimates, it is important to carefully consider the study aims when planning sampling procedures.},

  abstract = {Many fungal species in tropical Africa are useful, with high added value, and play essential roles in the structure and dynamic of ecosystems. However, the diversity, distribution, and uses by local populations of these non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and their respective habitats are still very poorly understood in sub-Saharan Africa in general and more specifically in C{\^o}te d'Ivoire. This study aims at (i) inventorying the wild useful mushrooms of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire within its major protected areas and their respective surrounding sociolinguistical groups, according to climatic and phytogeographical gradients, and (ii) recording ethnomycological knowledge and considerations of these local people. Field and ethnomycological surveys were conducted in the main and highest protected areas of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire (Como{\'e}, Marahou{\'e}, and Ta{\"i} national parks) and a set of their respective surrounding villages, along climatic and phytogeographical gradients. Standardized methods (permanent plots and opportunistic searches) were used for field surveys. In addition, a total 748 respondents belonging to 13 ethnic groups were interviewed at a rate of 300 interviewees during the preliminary investigations and 448 persons during the proper ethnomycological surveys. Sixty-eight useful wild fungal species, belonging to 17 families and 23 genera, were listed and collected. Four categories of usage were reported by the rural people (food, medicinal, belief and recreational), with a dominance of food and medicinal uses. Fifty-six species were reported to be used as food and 16 species as medicinal fungi. These uses varied not only from one sociolinguistical group to another but also from a visited village to another. The high number (41) of the reported useful species was found in the Sudano-Guinean savanna zone while 28 species were collected in the forest zone and 22 species in the forest-savanna mosaic zone. These mushrooms were either saprotrophic or symbiotic (ectomycorrhizal or termitophilic). Auricularia sp3, Psathyrella tuberculata, and Termitomyces spp. were found as the most commonly used mushrooms. These national scale field and ethnomycological surveys give one of the more complete but non-exhaustive list of useful mushrooms of C{\^o}te d'Ivoire. Mushrooms are relatively well known and used by the Ivorian people within the main phytogeographical zone of the country. These people also have an interest in all the functional groups with an important phytogeographical zone-fungal-specific used species. However, protected areas of the visited zones seem to represent the last sanctuaries of these organisms due to high rate of loss of natural habitats.},

  abstract = {Zygomycete fungi were classified as a single phylum, Zygomycota, based on sexual reproduction by zygospores, frequent asexual reproduction by sporangia, absence of multicellular sporocarps, and production of coenocytic hyphae, all with some exceptions. Molecular phylogenies based on one or a few genes did not support the monophyly of the phylum, however, and the phylum was subsequently abandoned. Here we present phylogenetic analyses of a genome-scale data set for 46 taxa, including 25 zygomycetes and 192 proteins, and we demonstrate that zygomycetes comprise two major clades that form a paraphyletic grade. A formal phylogenetic classification is proposed herein and includes two phyla, six subphyla, four classes and 16 orders. On the basis of these results, the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota are circumscribed. Zoopagomycota comprises Entomophtoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina and Zoopagomycotina; it constitutes the earliest diverging lineage of zygomycetes and contains species that are primarily parasites and pathogens of small animals (e.g. amoeba, insects, etc.) and other fungi, i.e. mycoparasites. Mucoromycota comprises Glomeromycotina, Mortierellomycotina, and Mucoromycotina and is sister to Dikarya. It is the more derived clade of zygomycetes and mainly consists of mycorrhizal fungi, root endophytes, and decomposers of plant material. Evolution of trophic modes, morphology, and analysis of genome-scale data are discussed.},

The evolutionary relationships of the kingdom have represented some of the more recalcitrant problems in systematics and phylogenetics. The advent of molecular phylogenetics, and more recently phylogenomics, has greatly advanced our understanding of the patterns and processes associated with fungal evolution, however. In this article, we review the major phyla, subphyla, and classes of the kingdom Fungi and provide brief summaries of ecologies, morphologies, and exemplar taxa. We also provide examples of how molecular phylogenetics and evolutionary genomics have advanced our understanding of fungal evolution within each of the phyla and some of the major classes. In the current classification we recognize 8 phyla, 12 subphyla, and 46 classes within the kingdom. The ancestor of fungi is inferred to be zoosporic, and zoosporic fungi comprise three lineages that are paraphyletic to the remainder of fungi. Fungi historically classified as zygomycetes do not form a monophyletic group and are paraphyletic to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are each monophyletic and collectively form the subkingdom Dikarya.},

Since then, rapid advancements in both sequencing technologies and computational biology have resulted in the sequencing of genomes for more than 800 species (e.g., http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/fungi/). These genomes represent a windfall of data that are informing evolutionary studies of fungi and the search for biological solutions to alternative fuels, bioremediation, carbon sequestration, and sustainable agriculture and forestry (2). Indeed, the marriage between genomics and phylogenetics occurred early, both in the use of phylogenetic techniques to study genome evolution and in the use of genome-scale data to infer evolutionary relationships. In this article we will review the impact of genomic-scale phylogenies, along with standard molecular phylogenies, on our understanding of the evolution of the fungal tree of life and the classification that communicates it.},

  abstract = {Lichens assemble in three parts Lichen growth forms cannot be recapitulated in the laboratory by culturing the plant and fungal partners together. Spribille et al. have discovered that the classical binary view of lichens is too simple. Instead, North American beard-like lichens are constituted of not two but three symbiotic partners: an ascomycetous fungus, a photosynthetic alga, and, unexpectedly, a basidiomycetous yeast. The yeast cells form the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus and may be important for its shape. The yeasts are ubiquitous and essential partners for most lichens and not the result of lichens being colonized or parasitized by other organisms. Science, this issue p. 488 For over 140 years, lichens have been regarded as a symbiosis between a single fungus, usually an ascomycete, and a photosynthesizing partner. Other fungi have long been known to occur as occasional parasites or endophytes, but the one lichen--one fungus paradigm has seldom been questioned. Here we show that many common lichens are composed of the known ascomycete, the photosynthesizing partner, and, unexpectedly, specific basidiomycete yeasts. These yeasts are embedded in the cortex, and their abundance correlates with previously unexplained variations in phenotype. Basidiomycete lineages maintain close associations with specific lichen species over large geographical distances and have been found on six continents. The structurally important lichen cortex, long treated as a zone of differentiated ascomycete cells, appears to consistently contain two unrelated fungi. Complete functioning lichen thalli have three partners: alga and ascomycete, plus a basidiomycete yeast.

  abstract = {DNA barcodes are useful for species discovery and species identification, but obtaining barcodes currently requires a well-equipped molecular laboratory and is time-consuming, and/or expensive. We here address these issues by developing a barcoding pipeline for Oxford Nanopore MinION™ and demonstrating that one flow cell can generate barcodes for 500 specimens despite the high basecall error rates of MinION™ reads. The pipeline overcomes these errors by first summarizing all reads for the same tagged amplicon as a consensus barcode. Consensus barcodes are overall mismatch-free but retain indel errors that are concentrated in homopolymeric regions. They are addressed with an optional error correction pipeline that is based on conserved amino acid motifs from publicly available barcodes. The effectiveness of this pipeline is documented by analysing reads from three MinION™ runs that represent three different stages of MinION™ development. They generated data for (i) 511 specimens of a mixed Diptera sample, (ii) 575 specimens of ants and (iii) 50 specimens of Chironomidae. The run based on the latest chemistry yielded MinION™ barcodes for 490 of the 511 specimens which were assessed against reference Sanger barcodes (N = 471). Overall, the MinION™ barcodes have an accuracy of 99.3\%--100\% with the number of ambiguous bases after correction ranging from {$<$}0.01\% to 1.5\% depending on which correction pipeline is used. We demonstrate that it requires 2 hr of sequencing to gather all information needed for obtaining reliable barcodes for most specimens ({$>$}90\%).

Most of these species live in the tropics and belong to animal taxa that combine small body size with high specimen abundance and large species richness.

Fortunately, species discovery could be greatly accelerated if DNA sequences could be used for sorting specimens to species. Morphological verification of such ``molecular operational taxonomic units'' (mOTUs) could then be based on dissection of a small subset of specimens.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}DNA barcodes are a useful tool for discovering, understanding, and monitoring biodiversity which are critical at a time when biodiversity loss is a major problem for many countries. However, widespread adoption of barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via 9innovation through subtraction9 and thus requires minimal lab equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing cost to \&lt;10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence by using the real-time sequencer MinION. We first describe cost-effective and rapid procedures for obtaining tagged amplicons. We then demonstrate how a portable MinION device can be used for real-time sequencing of tagged amplicons in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen science labs, schools). Small projects can use the flow cell dongle (9Flongle9) while large projects can rely on MinION flow cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data for a given project. We also provide amplicon coverage recommendations that are based on several runs of MinION flow cells (R10.3) which suggest that each run can generate \&gt;10,000 barcodes. Next, we present a novel software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges posed by the sequencing errors of MinION reads. This software is compatible with Windows10, Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based on two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes for the same specimens (\&gt;99.99\%). Lastly, we demonstrate how rapidly MinION data have improved by comparing the performance of sequential flow cell generations. We overall assert that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies, universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable and capital cost with scalability. Biodiversity loss is threatening the planet and the use of MinION barcodes will help with enabling an army of researchers and citizen scientists, which is necessary for effective biodiversity discovery and monitoring.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Based on the Xylariaceae, a hyperdiverse family of Ascomycota with over 1300 species, the advantages and pitfalls of these nomenclatural changes and their consequences for taxonomy and applied mycology are discussed. Historically, in the Xylariaceae, an 1F1N concept had already been realised: the types of all important genera are conserved. Most teleomorphs were discovered long before the anamorphic states and the latter did not receive separate names, hence no drastic taxonomic changes are expected. The new nomenclature calls for abandonment of some ill-defined anamorph genera, such as Muscodor. Other anamorph genera will be retained because their names refer to morphological symplesiomorphies that occur in several teleomorph genera. Various important taxa are only known from ancient specimens, and no DNA-based data are available. Much work still remains to be done to recollect these fungi, select epitypes, and settle their phylogenetic relationships. Until then, we recommend that taxonomic changes be applied at the suprageneric ranks whenever possible to maintain nomenclatural stability.},

The first approaches to organizing fungi into related groups relied on morphological characteristics (1). These approaches provided a broad framework to organize fungal organisms for taxonomic classification based on recognizable morphological characteristics such as spore shape, asexual and sexual structures, and in mushroom-forming fungi, the shape and presence/absence of gills, veil attachments, and spore color. In zoosporic chytrid fungi the characteristics seen by scanning electron microscopy of zoospores reveal that the ultrastructure of the kinetosomes and flagellum are all diagnostic for the classification of many lineages (2). However, the microscopic nature of many fungi and especially of yeast-forming fungi with limited visible differences, and the prevalence of convergent evolution to homoplasies or similar characteristics across a tree, has made taxonomic classification of groups of fungi difficult or easily misled. The invention and application of DNA sequencing (3) and PCR (4) and the development of primers to amplify fungal rRNA enabled a new era of molecular phylogenetic studies in fungi (5). These approaches provided invaluable information that was used to resolve the major fungal lineages (2 , 6 -- 20) and the delineation of species (21 -- 24). Using DNA approaches to study the entire fungal tree of life provided new insight into the order of branching of major groups and the timing of morphological changes such as the loss of the flagellum found in zoosporic fungi (14 , 17 , 18 , 25).},

Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+{$\Gamma$} yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {$\geq$}4000 taxa it also runs 2--3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25\,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51\,089 bp) taxa, respectively.Availability:Contact:Alexandros.Stamatakis@epfl.chSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In mammalian genomes, transition mutations occur significantly more frequently than transversions, and the optimal scoring of sequence alignments based on this substitution model differs from that derived assuming a uniform mutation model. The information from sequence alignments potentially available using an optimal scoring system is compared with that obtained using the BLASTN default scoring. A modified BLAST database search tool allows these, or other explicitly specified scoring matrices, to be utilized in computationally efficient queries of nucleic acid databases with nucleic acid query sequences.

Detailed comparative genomics studies have also expanded our understanding of species boundaries. Against this background, we explore the nature of fungal species and consider how this impacts our understanding of their genetics and evolution. The current body of evidence suggests that fungal species are unique evolutionary units that are separated from one another by boundaries that are ``porous'' under certain conditions (``semipermeable'' in analogy to the differential permeability of membranes). Overall, the penetrability of these boundaries depends on the relatedness between donor and recipient species, the spatial proximity of related species to one another during their evolution, and the evolutionary potential associated with the breach of a boundary. Furthermore, the semipermeable nature of species boundaries fundamentally affects the population genetics of a species, with potentially profound effects on its overall evolution and biology. This also influences the methodologies used in taxonomy, because some species appear capable of maintaining their genetic isolation despite extensive penetrability of their boundaries. Most analytical procedures are also not able to distinguish the signals of species boundary permeability from those associated with incomplete lineage sorting or intraspecific diversity. Collectively, these issues greatly complicate how we study and name fungi. An awareness of the nature of species, their boundaries and the biological and genomic signatures of boundary breaches, will enhance our ability to identify them and, perhaps more importantly, to develop realistic strategies to manage and manipulate their growth and distribution.},

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1~million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables---in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition---are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2\% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60\% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers---which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)---are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.},

  abstract = {abstract Filamentous fungi are a large and ancient clade of microorganisms that occupy a broad range of ecological niches (1 , 2). Fungi are recyclers, being major decomposers of plant debris (3); they form mycorrhizal symbiosis with 93\% of all flowering plant families (4), and they serve in the industrial production of proteins (5). However, fungi pose a threat to public health, the ecosystem, and our food security (6, 7). The success of filamentous fungi is largely due to their elongate hypha, a chain of cells separated from each other by septa (8). Hyphae grow rapidly by polarized exocytosis at the apex (9 -- 11), which allows the fungus to extend over long distances and invade many substrates, including soils and host tissues. Hyphal tip growth is initiated by establishment of a growth site and the subsequent maintenance of the growth axis, with transport of growth supplies, including membranes and proteins, delivered by motors along the cytoskeleton to the hyphal apex (12). Among the enzymes delivered are cell wall synthases that are exocytosed for local synthesis of the extracellular cell wall (13). Exocytosis is opposed by endocytic uptake of soluble and membrane-bound material into the cell (14). The first intracellular compartment in the endocytic pathway is the early endosomes (EEs), which emerge to perform essential additional functions as spatial organizers of the hyphal cell (15). Individual compartments within septated hyphae can communicate with each other via septal pores, which allow passage of cytoplasm or organelles (16) to help differentiation within the mycelium (17). This article introduces the reader to more detailed aspects of hyphal growth in fungi.},

The musculature, a common site of infection, provides access to biochemical (carbohydrate-rich) and physiological (mitochondria-rich) conditions conducive to prolific parasite replication and maturation. The significant proportion of body plan devoted to skeletal musculature in Crustacea provides the location for a highly efficient intracellular parasite factory. In this study, we utilize histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic evidence to describe a previously known (Inodosporus octospora) and novel (Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp.) microsporidian parasites infecting the musculature of the common prawn (Palaemon serratus) from the same site, at the same time of year. Despite similar clinical signs of infection, both parasites are otherwise distinct in terms of pathogenesis, morphology and phylogeny. Based upon partial subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) sequence, we show that that I. octospora may be identical to a Kabatana sp. previously described infecting two-spot goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Europe, or at least that Inodosporus and Kabatana genera are synonyms. In addition, SSU rDNA sequence for O. arlo places it within a distinct clade containing Ovipleistophora mirandellae and Ovipleistophora ovariae, both infecting the oocytes of freshwater fish in Europe. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for trophic-transfer between crustacean and fish hosts for two different microsporidians within clade 5 of the phylum. Furthermore, it demonstrates that morphologically and phylogenetically distinct microsporidians can infect the same tissues of the same host species to impart clinical signs which mimic infection with the other.},

  abstract = {Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal communities with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Difficulties in studying soil fungi have limited knowledge about how fungal communities are shaped. The objective of this thesis was to study factors influencing soil fungal communities, aiming for increased understanding of their effect on environmental processes. Using next generation sequencing, responses of fungal communities to their physical-chemical environment, and responses of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to logging, were investigated. In a trenching experiment, this technology, combined with measurements of decomposition and vertical nitrogen distribution, enabled evaluation of direct and indirect involvement of ECM fungi in humus decomposition.  Fungal community composition was found to be significantly related to soil fertility, with ascomycetes dominating in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased under more fertile conditions. ECM fungi were found to more or less disappear with complete clear-cutting and reestablishment of ECM diversity took several decades. However, a clear positive relationship between the amount of retention trees and ECM fungal species richness and abundance was found. By excluding ECM fungi, nitrogen limitation of saprotrophic fungi was released, increasing litter decomposition rates. However, this effect was overshadowed by an almost complete loss of oxidative enzyme activities in deeper humus layers, associated with removal of ECM fungi by trenching. Our results indicate ECM fungi to be the principal decomposers of boreal forest humus layers. This, together with the predictability of soil fungal communities, reinforces the importance and ability of integrating rhizosphere microorganisms, in particular ECM fungi, in forest ecosystem models.},

The aim of this investigation was to find out which of the three properties; low-accumulation, root accumulation or shoot accumulation of elements, occur in four of the most common wetland species growing on an old submerged mine tailings and if their properties can be determined by a hydroponic experiment. Above- and below-ground parts of Salix (mixed tissue from S. phylicifolia and S. borealis), Carex rostrata, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Phragmites australis were sampled and analysed for Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and As. Differences in uptake and translocation properties of the same plant species were observed between field-grown plants and plants grown in hydroponics. These differences were probably due to processes in the soil--root interface. Thus, hydroponic screening studies should not be used to find suitable species for vegetation of wet-covered mine tailings. Most species were found to have restricted translocation of elements to the shoot, i.e. they were root accumulators, and only the shoot concentrations of Salix for Cd and Zn and E. angustifolium for Pb might be toxic to grazing animals. Thus, plant establishment on submerged tailings can be a safe method to stabilise the metals.},

  abstract = {The resolution of the broad-scale tree of eukaryotes is constantly improving, but the evolutionary origin of several major groups remains unknown. Resolving the phylogenetic position of these ``orphan'' groups is important, especially those that originated early in evolution, because they represent missing evolutionary links between established groups. Telonemia is one such orphan taxon for which little is known. The group is composed of molecularly diverse biflagellated protists, often prevalent although not abundant in aquatic environments. Telonemia has been hypothesized to represent a deeply diverging eukaryotic phylum but no consensus exists as to where it is placed in the tree. Here, we established cultures and report the phylogenomic analyses of three new transcriptome data sets for divergent telonemid lineages. All our phylogenetic reconstructions, based on 248 genes and using site-heterogeneous mixture models, robustly resolve the evolutionary origin of Telonemia as sister to the Sar supergroup. This grouping remains well supported when as few as 60\% of the genes are randomly subsampled, thus is not sensitive to the sets of genes used but requires a minimal alignment length to recover enough phylogenetic signal. Telonemia occupies a crucial position in the tree to examine the origin of Sar, one of the most lineage-rich eukaryote supergroups. We propose the moniker ``TSAR'' to accommodate this new mega-assemblage in the phylogeny of eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {In modern oceans, eukaryotic phytoplankton is dominated by lineages with red algal-derived plastids such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores. Despite the ecological importance of these groups and many others representing a huge diversity of forms and lifestyles, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of their evolution and how they obtained their plastids. New hypotheses have emerged to explain the acquisition of red algal-derived plastids by serial endosymbiosis, but the chronology of these putative independent plastid acquisitions remains untested. Here, we establish a timeframe for the origin of red algal-derived plastids under scenarios of serial endosymbiosis, using Bayesian molecular clock analyses applied on a phylogenomic dataset with broad sampling of eukaryote diversity. We find that the hypotheses of serial endosymbiosis are chronologically possible, as the stem lineages of all red plastid-containing groups overlap in time. This period in the Meso- and Neoproterozoic Eras set the stage for the later expansion to dominance of red algal-derived primary production in the contemporary oceans, which profoundly altered the global geochemical and ecological conditions of the Earth.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life is continually improving, although the branching events at some of the deepest nodes remain elusive. The fungi are an ancient group of eukaryotes with a wide range of morphologies, life-history strategies, and ecological roles. While several recent phylogenomic analyses have been shown to be a powerful tool for uncovering even earliest diversifications, no study has yet examined the entire tree of fungi using a taxonomically comprehensive data set and suitable models of evolution. Here, we assembled a data set of 299 proteins from all recognised fungal groups for which genomic/transcriptomic data were available and subjected this to a battery of analyses, including tree inferences using site-heterogeneous mixture models and the Multi-Species Coalescent model. Tree topology was highly congruent and well supported, and any incongruence was found to result from an inability of some frequently used evolutionary models to model fast-evolving and heterogeneous sites. Our results provide higher resolution among early-branching lineages than previous studies, and shed light on hitherto highly contested evolutionary origins of the major fungal groups.},

To date, many of the proposed relationships among the phyla remain controversial and no phylogenomic study has examined the entire fungal tree using a taxonomically comprehensive dataset~and suitable models of evolution. We assembled and curated a 299-protein dataset with a taxon~sampling broad enough to encompass all recognized fungal diversity with available data, but selective~enough to run computationally intensive analyses using best-fitting models. Using a range of reconstruction methods, we were able to resolve many contested nodes, such as a sister relationship of Chytridiomyceta to all other non-Opisthosporidia fungi (with Chytridiomycota being sister to Monoblepharomycota~+ Neocallimastigomycota), a branching of Blastocladiomycota~+ Sanchytriomycota after the Chytridiomyceta but before other non-Opisthosporidia fungi, and a branching of Glomeromycota as sister to the Dikarya. Our up-to-date fungal tree of life will serve as a springboard for future investigations on the early evolution of fungi.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We first identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three effective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively different application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

  abstract = {In several real-life data-mining applications, data reside in very high (1000 or more) dimensional space, where both clustering techniques developed for low-dimensional spaces (k-means, BIRCH, CLARANS, CURE, DBScan, etc.) as well as visualization methods such as parallel coordinates or projective visualizations, are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a relationship-based approach that alleviates both problems, side-stepping the ``curse of-dimensionality'' issue by working in a suitable similarity space instead of the original high-dimensional attribute space. This intermediary similarity space can be suitably tailored to satisfy business criteria such as requiring customer clusters to represent comparable amounts of revenue. We apply efficient and scalable graph-partitioning-based clustering techniques in this space. The output from the clustering algorithm is used to re-order the data points so that the resulting permuted similarity matrix can be readily visualized in two dimensions, with clusters showing up as bands. While two-dimensional visualization of a similarity matrix is by itself not novel, its combination with the order-sensitive partitioning of a graph that captures the relevant similarity measure between objects provides three powerful properties: (i) the high-dimensionality of the data does not affect further processing once the similarity space is formed; (ii) it leads to clusters of (approximately) equal importance, and (iii) related clusters show up adjacent to one another, further facilitating the visualization of results. The visualization is very helpful for assessing and improving clustering. For example, actionable recommendations for splitting or merging of clusters can be easily derived, and it also guides the user toward the right number of clusters. Results are presented on a real retail industry dataset of several thousand customers and products, as well as on clustering of web-document collections and of web-log sessions.},

Taxonomy-independent clustering of the 16S rRNA gene is usually the first step in analyzing microbial communities. Dozens of algorithms have been developed in the last decade, but a comprehensive benchmark study is lacking. Here, we survey algorithms currently used by microbiologists, and compare seven representative methods in a large-scale benchmark study that addresses several issues of concern. A new experimental protocol was developed that allows different algorithms to be compared using the same platform, and several criteria were introduced to facilitate a quantitative evaluation of the clustering performance of each algorithm. We found that existing methods vary widely in their outputs, and that inappropriate use of distance levels for taxonomic assignments likely resulted in substantial overestimates of biodiversity in many studies. The benchmark study identified our recently developed ESPRIT-Tree, a fast implementation of the average linkage-based hierarchical clustering algorithm, as one of the best algorithms available in terms of computational efficiency and clustering accuracy.},

  abstract = {Exploring the secondary structure information of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) has been a promising approach in species delimitation. However, Compensatory base changes (CBC) concept employed in this approach turns futile when CBC is absent. This prompted us to investigate the utility of insertion/deletion (INDELs) and substitutions in fungal delineation at species level. Upon this rationale, 116 strains representing 97 species, belonging to 6 genera (Colletotrichum, Boeremia, Leptosphaeria, Peyronellaea, Plenodomus and Stagonosporopsis) of Ascomycota were retrieved from Q-bank for molecular morphometric analysis. CBC, INDELs and substitutions between the species of their respective genus were recorded. Most species combinations lacked CBC. Among the substitution events, transitions were predominant. INDELs were less frequent than the substitutions. These evolutionary events were mapped upon the helices to discern species specific variation sites. In 68 species unique variation sites were recognised. The remaining 29 species shared absolute similarity with distinctly named species. The variation sites catalogued in them overlapped with other distinct species and resulted in blurring of the species boundaries. Species specific variation sites recognized in this study are the preliminary results and they could be discerned with absolute confidence when larger datasets encompassing all described species of genera were investigated.

  abstract = {Molecular morphometrics is an emerging third dimensional aspect of fungal species delimitation. They have been demonstrated to be more informative than conventional barcoding methods. Hence in this study, foliar endophytic fungal (FEF) assemblages in three Magnoliopsida plants were delimited using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence---secondary structural features based phylogenetic analysis, also known as molecular morphometrics. A total of 392 FEF isolates were obtained from the Aglaia elaeagnoidea, Flacourtia inermis, and Premna serratifolia leaves and grouped into 98 morphotypes. Among these host plants, P. serratifolia showed the maximum percentage of colonization frequency. Representatives of each morphotype was sequenced and subjected to further molecular characterization. The results revealed that morphotypes were belonged to the phylum of Ascomycota, distributed over two classes (Sordariomycetes (68.59\%) and Dothideomycetes (31.41\%)), 6 orders and 19 genera. Based on compensatory base changes (CBC) analysis and absolute identity of ITS2 structure, 21, 20 and 23 species were recognized from A. elaeagnoidea, F. inermis, and P. serratifolia respectively. Diversity indices were higher in A. elaeagnoidea, despite it accounted for a modest 16.8\% of total isolates recorded in this study. The genus Colletotrichum was predominant in A. elaeagnoidea (39\%) and P. serratifolia (48\%). Similarly, Diaporthe (43\%) was dominant in F. inermis. Several host-specific species were also observed. This study concludes that these plants host diverse species of Ascomycota. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on FEF diversity from these plants. Also, the inclusion of ITS2 secondary structure information along with the sequence provides a further dimension to resolve the inherent problems in identification of fungal species.},

Biodiversitas 20: 3063-3069. Vaginal Candidiasis is an infection caused by a yeast called Candida which may be resulted in different virulences, thus leading to a varied drug of choice for therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex-PCR test in detecting Candida species in women with clinical diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis. There were 79 vaginal swab samples which fulfill inclusion criteria. Samples were cultured at ASD media for isolation of Candida spp. Identification of Candida spp. was conducted using both biochemical fermentation and multiplex-PCR methods. Primers pairs used in multiplex-PCR were universal primer ITS1 and ITS2, and specific primer CA3 and CA4. The identification test of multiplex-PCR resulted in Candida krusei: sensitivity: 100\%, specificity:61,1\%, Positive Prediction Value (PPV):63.2\%, Negative Prediction Value (NPV): 100\%; C. glabrata: sensitivity:0\%, specificity: 100\% PPV: 0\% NPV: 76.7\%; C. tropicalis: sensitivity:100\%, spesificity:100\%, PPV: 100\% NPV: 100\%; C. albicans: sensitivity: 33.3\%, specificity: 100\%, PPV: 100\%, NPV: 93.1\% and C. stellatoidea: sensitivity:: 100\%, specificity:92.6\%, PPV: 60\%, NPV: 100\%. These results suggested that multiplex-PCR method becomes a rapid alternative in identifying species of Candida due to its high sensitivity and high specificity.},

Three AMF-specific primer pairs targeting the 18S and 28S rRNA genes and a fungal universal primer pair targeting the ITS region were examined using soil DNA as the template. The effect of nested PCR was also evaluated. Only a few AMF sequences were obtained from a fungal universal primer targeting the ITS region. On the other hand, use of AMF-specific primers improved AMF detection rates (35--98\%). Particularly, almost all of the sequences obtained with the nested PCR were AMF-related sequences. However, the AMF community compositions were differentiated among the primer pairs. In addition, the number of AMF taxa and diversity decreased with the nested PCR, suggesting that it affected AMF community analysis.},

  abstract = {Alignment-free methods are alternatives to alignment-based methods when searching sequence data sets. The output from an alignment-free sequence comparison is a similarity score, the interpretation of which is not straightforward. We propose objective functions to interpret and calibrate outputs from alignment-free searches, noting that different objective functions are necessary for different biological contexts. This leads to advantages: visualising and comparing score distributions, including those from true positives, may be a relatively simple method to gain insight into the performance of different metrics. Using an empirical approach with both DNA and protein sequences, we characterise different similarity score distributions generated under different parameters. In particular, we demonstrate how sequence length can affect the scores. We show that scores of true positive sequence pairs may correlate significantly with their mean length; and even if the correlation is weak, the relative difference in length of the sequence pair may significantly reduce the effectiveness of alignment-free metrics. Importantly, we show how objective functions can be used with test data to accurately estimate the probability of true positives. This can significantly increase the utility of alignment-free approaches. Finally, we have developed a general-purpose software tool called KAST for use in high-throughput workflows on Linux clusters.},

Data from Ghana show that these forests have two-peak annual rainfall between 850 and 1350 mm, with 6?10 dry months ({$<$} 100 mm rain) each year; by relatively nutrient-rich soils developed over a variety of rock types; by short stature (tallest trees 10-40 m) relatively high deciduousness in the upper canopy and evergreenness in the understorey; and by a distinctive flora which changes gradually towards areas of higher rainfall but abruptly at the forest-savanna boundary. Dry forests near the forest-savanna boundary form a distinctive sub-type as a result of occasional encroachment by litter fires which have become more common in the 1980's. Evidence is presented to suggest that many parts of the forest zone in West Africa may have been subject to fires most often in the dry forest types. Past fires are likely to have had a profound influence on the composition of the present forest canopy. Fire mortality is greatest in small trees, whilst drought (without fire) kills more large trees. This thinning process allows rapid recolonisation especially by Marantaceous and Zingiberaceous forbs and by pioneer trees. Seedlings of canopy trees grow beneath these colonising plants. Recurrent fires seriously impede the recovery of burnt forest and are a principal concern for the rehabilitation of dry forests.},

Null model investigations of community assembly exemplify the challenges involved because they typically include subjectively defined ``regional species pools.'' The burgeoning field of community phylogenetics appears poised to face similar challenges. Our objective is to quantify the scope of the problem of scale dependency by comparing the phylogenetic structure of assemblages across contrasting geographic and taxonomic scales. We conduct phylogenetic analyses on communities within three tropical forests, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to two scaleable inputs: taxonomy and species pool size. We show that (1) estimates of phylogenetic overdispersion within local assemblages depend strongly on the taxonomic makeup of the local assemblage and (2) comparing the phylogenetic structure of a local assemblage to a species pool drawn from increasingly larger geographic scales results in an increased signal of phylogenetic clustering. We argue that, rather than posing a problem, ``scale sensitivities'' are likely to reveal general patterns of diversity that could help identify critical scales at which local or regional influences gain primacy for the structuring of communities. In this way, community phylogenetics promises to fill an important gap in community ecology and biogeography research.},

  abstract = {Species diversity is promoted and maintained by ecological and evolutionary processes operating on species attributes through space and time. The degree to which variability in species function regulates distribution and promotes coexistence of species has been debated. Previous work has attempted to quantify the relative importance of species function by using phylogenetic relatedness as a proxy for functional similarity. The key assumption of this approach is that function is phylogenetically conserved. If this assumption is supported, then the phylogenetic dispersion in a community should mirror the functional dispersion. Here we quantify functional trait dispersion along several key axes of tree life-history variation and on multiple spatial scales in a Neotropical dry-forest community. We next compare these results to previously reported patterns of phylogenetic dispersion in this same forest. We find that, at small spatial scales, coexisting species are typically more functionally clustered than expected, but traits related to adult and regeneration niches are overdispersed. This outcome was repeated when the analyses were stratified by size class. Some of the trait dispersion results stand in contrast to the previously reported phylogenetic dispersion results. In order to address this inconsistency we examined the strength of phylogenetic signal in traits at different depths in the phylogeny. We argue that: (1) while phylogenetic relatedness may be a good general multivariate proxy for ecological similarity, it may have a reduced capacity to depict the functional mechanisms behind species coexistence when coexisting species simultaneously converge and diverge in function; and (2) the previously used metric of phylogenetic signal provided erroneous inferences about trait dispersion when married with patterns of phylogenetic dispersion.},

  abstract = {Many research groups are estimating trees containing anywhere from a few thousands to hundreds of thousands of species, toward the eventual goal of the estimation of a Tree of Life, containing perhaps as many as several million leaves. These phylogenetic estimations present enormous computational challenges, and current computational methods are likely to fail to run even on data sets in the low end of this range. One approach to estimate a large species tree is to use phylogenetic estimation methods (such as maximum likelihood) on a supermatrix produced by concatenating multiple sequence alignments for a collection of markers; however, the most accurate of these phylogenetic estimation methods are extremely computationally intensive for data sets with more than a few thousand sequences. Supertree methods, which assemble phylogenetic trees from a collection of trees on subsets of the taxa, are important tools for phylogeny estimation where phylogenetic analyses based upon maximum likelihood (ML) are infeasible. In this paper, we introduce SuperFine, a meta-method that utilizes a novel two-step procedure in order to improve the accuracy and scalability of supertree methods. Our study, using both simulated and empirical data, shows that SuperFine-boosted supertree methods produce more accurate trees than standard supertree methods, and run quickly on very large data sets with thousands of sequences. Furthermore, SuperFine-boosted matrix representation with parsimony (MRP, the most well-known supertree method) approaches the accuracy of ML methods on supermatrix data sets under realistic conditions.},

  abstract = {Nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes represent the oldest repetitive fraction universal to all eukaryotic genomes. Their deeply anchored universality and omnipresence during eukaryotic evolution reflects in multiple roles and functions reaching far beyond ribosomal synthesis. Merely the copy number of non-transcribed rRNA genes is involved in mechanisms governing e.g., maintenance of genome integrity and control of cellular aging. Their copy number can vary in response to environmental cues, in cellular stress sensing, in development of cancer and other diseases. While reaching hundreds of copies in humans, there are records of up to 20,000 copies in fish and frogs and even 400,000 copies in ciliates forming thus a literal subgenome or an rDNAome within the genome. From the compositional and evolutionary dynamics viewpoint, the precursor 45S rDNA represents universally GC-enriched, highly recombining and homogenized regions. Hence, it is not accidental that both rDNA sequence and the corresponding rRNA secondary structure belong to established phylogenetic markers broadly used to infer phylogeny on multiple taxonomical levels including species delimitation. However, these multiple roles of rDNAs have been treated and discussed as being separate and independent from each other. Here, I aim to address nuclear rDNAs in an integrative approach to better assess the complexity of rDNA importance in the evolutionary context.},

  abstract = {Wild mushrooms are gaining more popularity among consumers. Commercial picking of mushrooms has increased in Finland, which can have an effect on forest management. Currently, mushrooms are considered a side-product of forestry, but understanding the factors affecting the variation in yields would enable the joint production of timber and mushrooms. This study aims to provide empirical models for predicting the annual yields of marketed mushrooms in planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in eastern Finland. Separate models were fitted for Boletus edulis, Lactarius spp. and all marketed mushrooms. Mushroom data were inventoried from 56 sample plots for the period 2010--2014. Stand and annual climatic variables were used as predictors in the modelling. A non-linear mixed-effect modelling (NLMM) approach was used to account for between-plot and between-year variation in mushroom yields. The highest yields of B. edulis were obtained just before the first thinning phase of stand development (at the age of 25--30 years and the stand density of 25 m2/ha). The peak in the yields of Lactarius spp. and all marketed mushrooms was slightly later. The mushroom yields were promoted by a warm pre-season (in July) and wet conditions during the fruiting season (in August). In a good mushroom stand, the contribution of mushrooms to the total net present income (with a 3\% interest rate) during the entire rotation was 25\%. The results of this study enable the prediction of mushroom yields along with the development of spruce stands and thus support multiple-use planning and management of forests.},

They provide contextual information essential to interpreting the data. In this paper, we describe an automated system for choosing positions and labels for axis tick marks. Our system extends Wilkinson's optimization-based labeling approach to create a more robust, full-featured axis labeler. We define an expanded space of axis labelings by automatically generating additional nice numbers as needed and by permitting the extreme labels to occur inside the data range. These changes provide flexibility in problematic cases, without degrading quality elsewhere. We also propose an additional optimization criterion, legibility, which allows us to simultaneously optimize over label formatting, font size, and orientation. To solve this revised optimization problem, we describe the optimization function and an efficient search algorithm. Finally, we compare our method to previous work using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This paper is a good example of how ideas from automated graphic design can be applied to information visualization.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new annotation tool ``FungalTraits'' was created based on the previous FUNGuild and FunFun databases, which has attracted high attention in the scientific community. These databases were widely used to gain more information from fungal sequencing datasets by assigning fungal functional traits. More than 1500 publications so far employed FUNGuild and the aim of this study is to compare this successful database with the recent FungalTraits database. Quality and quantity of the assignment by FUNGuild and FungalTraits to a fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)--based amplicon sequencing dataset on amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were addressed. Sequencing dataset was derived from leaves and needles of 12 temperate broadleaved and coniferous tree species. We found that FungalTraits assigned more functional traits than FUNGuild, and especially the coverage of saprotrophs, plant pathogens, and endophytes was higher while lichenized fungi revealed similar findings. Moreover, ASVs derived from leaves and needles of each tree species were better assigned to all available fungal traits as well as to saprotrophs by FungalTraits compared to FUNGuild in particular for broadleaved tree species. Assigned ASV richness as well as fungal functional community composition was higher and more diverse after analyses with FungalTraits compared to FUNGuild. Moreover, datasets of both databases showed similar effect of environmental factors for saprotrophs but for endophytes, unidentical patterns of significant corresponding factors were obtained. As a conclusion, FungalTraits is superior to FUNGuild in assigning a higher quantity and quality of ASVs as well as a higher frequency of significant correlations with environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models are used to evaluate the variables that affect the distribution and abundance of species and to predict biodiversity. Historically, such models have been fitted to each species independently. While independent models can provide useful information regarding distribution and abundance, they ignore the fact that, after accounting for environmental covariates, residual interspecies dependence persists. With stacking of individual models, misleading behaviors, may arise. In particular, individual models often imply too many species per location. Recently developed joint species distribution models have application to presence--absence, continuous or discrete abundance, abundance with large numbers of zeros, and discrete, ordinal, and compositional data. Here, we deal with the challenge of joint modeling for a large number of species. To appreciate the challenge in the simplest way, with just presence/absence (binary) response and say, S species, we have an S-way contingency table with 2S cell probabilities. Even if S is as small as 100 this is an enormous table, infeasible to work with without some structure to reduce dimension. We develop a computationally feasible approach to accommodate a large number of species (say order 103) that allows us to: 1) assess the dependence structure across species; 2) identify clusters of species that have similar dependence patterns; and 3) jointly predict species distributions. To do so, we build hierarchical models capturing dependence between species at the first or ``data'' stage rather than at a second or ``mean'' stage. We employ the Dirichlet process for clustering in a novel way to reduce dimension in the joint covariance structure. This last step makes computation tractable. We use Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern region of the United States to demonstrate our method. It consists of presence--absence measurements for 112 tree species, observed east of the Mississippi. As a proof of concept for our dimension reduction approach, we also include simulations using continuous and binary data.},

Current estimates of global species richness are highly uncertain, and the importance of stochastic vs. deterministic forces in the assembly of fungal communities is unknown. Molecular studies have so far failed to reach saturated, comprehensive estimates of fungal diversity. To obtain a more accurate estimate of global fungal diversity, we used a direct molecular approach to census diversity in a boreal ecosystem with precisely known plant diversity, and we carefully evaluated adequacy of sampling and accuracy of species delineation. We achieved the first exhaustive enumeration of fungi in soil, recording 1002 taxa in this system. We show that the fungus : plant ratio in Picea mariana forest soils from interior Alaska is at least 17:1 and is regionally stable. A global extrapolation of this ratio would suggest 6 million species of fungi, as opposed to leading estimates ranging from 616 000 to 1.5 million. We also find that closely related fungi often occupy divergent niches. This pattern is seen in fungi spanning all major functional guilds and four phyla, suggesting a major role of deterministic niche partitioning in community assembly. Extinctions and range shifts are reorganizing biodiversity on Earth, yet our results suggest that 98\% of fungi remain undescribed and that many of these species occupy unique niches.},

  abstract = {With the termination of dual nomenclature, each fungus may have only one name. Now mycologists must choose between genus names formerly applied to taxa with either asexual or sexual reproductive modes, a choice that often influences the breadth of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in a genus, and even its monophyly. We use the asexual genus Aspergillus to examine the problems involved in such choices because (a) 11 sexual generic names are associated with it and (b) phenotypic variation and genetic divergence within sexual genera are low but between sexual genera are high. As a result, in the case of Aspergillus, applying the asexual name to the many sexual genera masks information now conveyed by the genus names and would lead to taxonomic inconsistency in the Eurotiales because this large Aspergillus would then embrace more genetic divergence than neighboring clades comprised of two or more genera. Two proposals have been published concerning this problem as it relates to Aspergillus: one advocates a broad concept, referred to here as 'Wide Aspergillus', which embraces as many Aspergillus species as possible while maintaining Penicillium as a separate genus; the other, referred to here as 'Narrow Aspergillus', preserves this genus for a much smaller group of closely related species and retains many of the sexual genera. Phylogenetic analyses detailed here show that, to be monophyletic, Wide Aspergillus must embrace several genera morphologically discordant with Aspergillus, including Penicillium, Phialosimplex and Polypaecilum. Likelihood ratio tests reject a Wide Aspergillus that excludes Phialosimplex and Polypaecilum. Phylogenetic Rank Boundary Optimization, which employs the genetic divergence measure, maximum subtree height, to assess inconsistency in the ranking of genera and species, shows that Narrow Aspergillus provides a more consistent taxonomy than Wide Aspergillus. Adopting Narrow Aspergillus and retaining sexual names instead of adopting Wide Aspergillus will result in genera that convey precise morphological and physiological information, that are monophyletic, and that are taxonomically consistent.},

This review of fungal genetic variation begins with a survey of its sources and then discusses means of associating natural genetic variation with phenotypic variation, including phenotypes that are important to fungal adaptation or those that interest cell and developmental biologists engaged in basic or translational research. The tale of the study of fungal genetic variation is also a tale of advances in genomic science, and it is appropriate to note that the first Eukaryote to have its genome sequenced was a fungus, the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1). Shortly thereafter, yeast was joined by filamentous Ascomycota, e.g., Neurospora (2), and Basidiomycota, e.g., Phanerochaetae (3). Not long after, three Aspergillus species were sequenced--Aspergillus oryzae (4), Aspergillus fumigatus (5), and Aspergillus nidulans--and the comparisons of their genomes (6), along with those of yeasts closely related to S. cerevisiae (7), represent landmarks in the field of comparative fungal genomics. A survey taken in April 2017 of fungal genomicists associated with the Joint Genome Institute and FungiDB estimated the number of fungal species with sequenced and assembled genomes at 2,000 and estimated that another 1,000 to 1,500 genomes represent multiple individuals from species that are studied by population genomics. No other group of eukaryotes enjoys as deep a genomic database as is seen for the fungi.},

  abstract = {Plants of Typha latifolia L. derived from overwintering rootstocks collected from a site contaminated with copper and nickel and an uncontaminated control location were maintained in the laboratory for a minimum of three vegetative generations. Uptake of copper and nickel by both clones from contaminated nutrient solutions was greater than from control solutions. Growth of both clones was inhibited by 100{\enspace}{$\mu$}g{\enspace}g-1 Cu--EDTA, and 600{\enspace}{$\mu$}g{\enspace}g-1 Ni--EDTA. Evidence suggesting that copper and nickel tolerance has evolved in the population from the contaminated site could not be detected. Indeed clones from the uncontaminated site showed greater growth under copper stress than clones from the contaminated site, while growth of both clones was equally depressed under conditions of nickel stress., Des plants de Typha latifolia L. provenant de rhizomes hivernaux ont {\'e}t{\'e} r{\'e}colt{\'e}s dans un site contamin{\'e} par du cuivre et du nickel et dans un site t{\'e}moin non-contamin{\'e}, puis ont {\'e}t{\'e} maintenus au laboratoire pendant au moins trois g{\'e}n{\'e}rations v{\'e}g{\'e}tatives. Chez les deux sortes de clones, l'absorption du cuivre et du nickel {\`a} partir de solutions nutritives contamin{\'e}es est plus {\'e}lev{\'e}e qu'{\`a} partir de solutions t{\'e}moins.

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is a widespread plant nutrition strategy in Australia, especially in semiarid regions. This study aims to determine the diversity, community structure and host preference of ECM fungi in a Tasmanian wet sclerophyll forest. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified based on anatomotyping and rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-large subunit (LSU) sequence analysis using taxon-specific primers. Host tree roots were identified based on root morphology and length differences of the chloroplast trnL region. A total of 123 species of ECM fungi were recovered from root tips of Eucalyptus regnans (Myrtaceae), Pomaderris apetala (Rhamnaceae) and Nothofagus cunninghamii (Nothofagaceae). The frequency of two thirds of the most common ECM fungi from several lineages was significantly influenced by host species. The lineages of Cortinarius, Tomentella-Thelephora, Russula-Lactarius, Clavulina, Descolea and Laccaria prevailed in the total community and their species richness and relative abundance did not differ by host species. This study demonstrates that strongly host-preferring, though not directly specific, ECM fungi may dominate the below-ground community. Apart from the richness of Descolea, Tulasnella and Helotiales and the lack of Suillus-Rhizopogon and Amphinema-Tylospora, the ECM fungal diversity and phylogenetic community structure is similar to that in the Holarctic realm.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizosphere microbes enhance functioning of the plant--soil interface, but little is known of their ecology. This study aims to characterize the ascomycete communities associated with ectomycorrhizas in two Tasmanian wet sclerophyll forests. We hypothesize that both the phyto- and mycobiont, mantle type, soil microbiotope and geographical distance affect the diversity and occurrence of the associated ascomycetes. Using the culture-independent rDNA sequence analysis, we demonstrate a high diversity of these fungi on different hosts and habitats. Plant host has the strongest effect on the occurrence of the dominant species and community composition of ectomycorrhiza-associated fungi. Root endophytes, soil saprobes, myco-, phyto- and entomopathogens contribute to the ectomycorrhiza-associated ascomycete community. Taxonomically these Ascomycota mostly belong to the orders Helotiales, Hypocreales, Chaetothyriales and Sordariales. Members of Helotiales from both Tasmania and the Northern Hemisphere are phylogenetically closely related to root endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting their strong ecological and evolutionary links. Ectomycorrhizal mycobionts from Australia and the Northern Hemisphere are taxonomically unrelated to each other and phylogenetically distant to other helotialean root-associated fungi, indicating independent evolution. The ubiquity and diversity of the secondary root-associated fungi should be considered in studies of mycorrhizal communities to avoid overestimating the richness of true symbionts.},

  abstract = {In the fungal kingdom, the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) symbiosis has evolved independently in multiple groups that are referred to as lineages. A growing number of molecular studies in the fields of mycology, ecology, soil science, and microbiology generate vast amounts of sequence data from fungi in their natural habitats, particularly from soil and roots. However, as the number and diversity of sequences has increased, it has become increasingly difficult to accurately identify the fungal species in these samples and to determine their trophic modes. In particular, there has been significant controversy regarding which fungal groups form ectomycorrhizas, the morphological ``exploration types'' that these fungi form on roots, and the ecological strategies that they use to obtain nutrients. To address this problem, we have synthesized the phylogenetic and taxonomic breadth of EcM fungi by using the wealth of accumulated sequence data. We also compile available information about exploration types of 143 genera of EcM fungi (including 67 new reports) that can be tentatively used to help infer the ecological strategies of different fungal groups. Phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA ITS and LSU sequences enabled us to recognize 20 novel lineages of EcM fungi. Most of these are rare and have a limited distribution. Five new lineages occur exclusively in tropical and subtropical habitats. Altogether 46 fungal genera were added to the list of EcM fungal taxa and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow rapidly as taxonomic works segregate species-rich genera into smaller, monophyletic units. Three genera were removed from the list of EcM groups due to refined taxonomic and phylogenetic information. In all, we suggest that EcM symbiosis has arisen independently in 78--82 fungal lineages that comprise 251--256 genera. The EcM fungal diversity of tropical and southern temperate ecosystems remains significantly understudied and we expect that these regions are most likely to reveal additional EcM taxa.},

By the use of a comparative phylogenetic approach and ancestral state reconstructions, we addressed the global biogeography, rate of evolution and evolutionary origin of the widely distributed ectomycorrhizal (EcM) /sebacina lineage that forms a large proportion of the Sebacinales order. We downloaded all publicly available internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and metadata and supplemented sequence information from three genes to construct dated phylogenies and test biogeographic hypotheses. The /sebacina lineage evolved 45?57~Myr ago that groups it with relatively young EcM taxa in other studies. The most parsimonious origin for /sebacina is inferred to be North American temperate coniferous forests. Among biogeographic traits, region and biome exhibited stronger phylogenetic signal than host family. Consistent with the resource availability (environmental energy) hypothesis, the ITS region is evolving at a faster rate in tropical than nontropical regions. Most biogeographic regions exhibited substantial phylogenetic clustering suggesting a strong impact of dispersal limitation over a large geographic scale. In northern Holarctic regions, however, phylogenetic distances and phylogenetic grouping of isolates indicate multiple recent dispersal events.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Much of the ecological, taxonomic and biodiversity research relies on understanding of phylogenetic relationships among organisms. There are multiple available classification systems that all suffer from differences in naming, incompleteness, presence of multiple non-monophyletic entities and poor correspondence of divergence times. These issues render taxonomic comparisons across the main groups of eukaryotes and all life in general difficult at best. By using the monophyly criterion, roughly comparable time of divergence and information from multiple phylogenetic reconstructions, I propose an alternative classification system for the domain Eukarya to improve hierarchical taxonomical comparability for animals, plants, fungi and multiple protist groups. Following this rationale, I propose 32 kingdoms of eukaryotes that are treated in 10 subdomains. These kingdoms are further separated into 43, 115, 140 and 353 taxa at the level of subkingdom, phylum, subphylum and class, respectively (http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/587483). Most of the names have been used previously or these were deduced from those of the type taxa to be able to unambiguously link genera to higher taxonomic levels. In the era of phylogenomics, understanding about the phylogenetic relationships among organisms is rapidly increasing. Classifications systems must keep pace with this race to serve the research community by consistent improvements in precision in terms of taxonomic resolution and maintaining monophyly of the ingredient taxa.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We provide rough phylogenetic placement and principal niche analysis for {$>$}40 previously unrecognized fungal groups at the order and class level from global soil samples based on combined 18S (nSSU) and 28S (nLSU) rRNA gene sequences. Especially, Rozellomycota (Cryptomycota), Zygomycota s.lat, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota are rich in novel fungal lineages, most of which exhibit distinct preferences for climate and soil pH. This study uncovers the great phylogenetic richness of previously unrecognized order- to phylum-level fungal lineages. Most of these rare groups are distributed in different ecosystems of the world but exhibit distinct ecological preferences for climate or soil pH. Across the fungal kingdom, tropical and non-tropical habitats are equally likely to harbor novel groups. We advocate that a combination of traditional and high-throughput sequencing methods enable efficient recovery and phylogenetic placement of such unknown taxonomic groups.},

Evolutionary ecological hypotheses of the recovered taxa and Species Hypotheses are difficult to test due to problems with alignments and the lack of a phylogenetic backbone. We propose an updated phylum- and class-level fungal classification accounting for monophyly and divergence time so that the main taxonomic ranks are more informative. Based on phylogenies and divergence time estimates, we adopt phylum rank to Aphelidiomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Glomeromycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota and Olpidiomycota. We accept nine subkingdoms to accommodate these 18 phyla. We consider the kingdom Nucleariae (phyla Nuclearida and Fonticulida) as a sister group to the Fungi. We also introduce a perl script and a newick-formatted classification backbone for assigning Species Hypotheses into a hierarchical taxonomic framework, using this or any other classification system. We provide an example of testing evolutionary ecological hypotheses based on a global soil fungal data set.},

  abstract = {Molecular identification methods, in particular high-throughput sequencing tools, have greatly improved our knowledge about fungal diversity and biogeography, but many of the recovered taxa from natural environments cannot be identified to species or even higher taxonomic levels. This study addresses the phylogenetic placement of previously unrecognized fungal groups by using two complementary approaches: (i) third-generation amplicon sequencing analysis of DNA from global soil samples, screening out ITS reads of\,{$<$}\,90\% similarity to other available Sanger sequences, and (ii) analysis of common fungal taxa that were previously indicated to be enigmatic in terms of taxonomic placement based on the ITS sequences alone (so-called top50 sequences). For the global soil samples, we chose to amplify the full rRNA gene operon using four partly overlapping amplicons and multiple newly developed primers or primer combinations that cover nearly all fungi and a vast majority of non-fungal eukaryotes. We extracted the rRNA 18S (SSU) and 28S (LSU) genes and performed phylogenetic analyses against carefully selected reference material. Both SSU and LSU analyses placed most soil sequences and top50 sequences to known orders and classes, but tens of monophyletic groups and single sequences remained outside described taxa. Furthermore, the LSU analyses recovered a few small groups of sequences that may potentially represent novel phyla. We conclude that rRNA genes-based phylogenetic analyses are efficient tools for determining phylogenetic relationships of fungal taxa that cannot be placed to any order or class using ITS sequences alone. However, in many instances, longer rRNA gene sequences and availability of both SSU and LSU reads are needed to improve taxonomic resolution. By leveraging third-generation sequencing from global soil samples, we successfully provided phylogenetic placement for many previously unidentified sequences and broadened our view on the fungal tree of life, with 10--20\% new order-level taxa. In addition, the PacBio sequence data greatly extends fungal class-level information in reference databases.},

Here we provide an overview about current best practices in metabarcoding analysis of fungal communities, from experimental design through molecular and computational analyses. By re-analysing published datasets, we find that operational taxonomic units (OTUs) outperform amplified sequence variants (ASVs) in recovering fungal diversity, which is particularly evident for long markers. Additionally, analysis of the full-length ITS region allows more accurate taxonomic placement of fungi and other eukaryotes compared with the ITS2 subregion. We conclude that metabarcoding analyses of fungi are especially promising for co-analyses with the functional metagenomic or transcriptomic data, integrating fungi in the entire microbiome, recovery of novel fungal lineages and ancient organisms as well as barcoding of old specimens including type material.}

  abstract = {Fungi play pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning, but little is known about their global patterns of diversity, endemicity, vulnerability to global change drivers and conservation priority areas. We applied the high-resolution PacBio sequencing technique to identify fungi based on a long DNA marker that revealed a high proportion of hitherto unknown fungal taxa. We used a Global Soil Mycobiome consortium dataset to test relative performance of various sequencing depth standardization methods (calculation of residuals, exclusion of singletons, traditional and SRS rarefaction, use of Shannon index of diversity) to find optimal protocols for statistical analyses. Altogether, we used six global surveys to infer these patterns for soil-inhabiting fungi and their functional groups. We found that residuals of log-transformed richness (including singletons) against log-transformed sequencing depth yields significantly better model estimates compared with most other standardization methods. With respect to global patterns, fungal functional groups differed in the patterns of diversity, endemicity and vulnerability to main global change predictors. Unlike {$\alpha$}-diversity, endemicity and global-change vulnerability of fungi and most functional groups were greatest in the tropics. Fungi are vulnerable mostly to drought, heat, and land cover change. Fungal conservation areas of highest priority include wetlands and moist tropical ecosystems.},

Natural forests harbour plants belonging to different mycorrhiza types that differ in their microbiome and carbon and nutrient cycling properties. Here we describe the MycoPhylo field experiment that encompasses 116 woody plant species from three mycorrhiza types and 237 plots, with plant diversity and mycorrhiza type diversity ranging from one to four and one to three per plot, respectively. The MycoPhylo experiment enables us to test hypotheses about the plant species, species diversity, mycorrhiza type, and mycorrhiza type diversity effects and their phylogenetic context on soil microbial diversity and functioning and soil processes. Alongside with other experiments in the TreeDivNet consortium, MycoPhylo will contribute to our understanding of the tree diversity effects on soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across biomes, especially from the mycorrhiza type and phylogenetic conservatism perspectives.},

Here we provide an overview of current best practices in metabarcoding analysis of fungal communities, from experimental design through molecular and computational analyses. By reanalysing published data sets, we demonstrate that operational taxonomic units (OTUs) outperform amplified sequence variants (ASVs) in recovering fungal diversity, a finding that is particularly evident for long markers. Additionally, analysis of the full-length ITS region allows more accurate taxonomic placement of fungi and other eukaryotes compared to the ITS2 subregion. Finally, we show that specific methods for compositional data analyses provide more reliable estimates of shifts in community structure. We conclude that metabarcoding analyses of fungi are especially promising for integrating fungi into the full microbiome and broader ecosystem functioning context, recovery of novel fungal lineages and ancient organisms as well as barcoding of old specimens including type material.},

  abstract = {Fungi are highly diverse organisms, which provide multiple ecosystem services. However, compared with charismatic animals and plants, the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi have been little explored. Here, we examined endemicity patterns, global change vulnerability and conservation priority areas for functional groups of soil fungi based on six global surveys using a high-resolution, long-read metabarcoding approach. We found that the endemicity of all fungi and most functional groups peaks in tropical habitats, including Amazonia, Yucatan, West-Central Africa, Sri Lanka, and New Caledonia, with a negligible island effect compared with plants and animals. We also found that fungi are predominantly vulnerable to drought, heat and land-cover change, particularly in dry tropical regions with high human population density. Fungal conservation areas of highest priority include herbaceous wetlands, tropical forests, and woodlands. We stress that more attention should be focused on the conservation of fungi, especially root symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi in tropical regions as well as unicellular early-diverging groups and macrofungi in general. Given the low overlap between the endemicity of fungi and macroorganisms, but high conservation needs in both groups, detailed analyses on distribution and conservation requirements are warranted for other microorganisms and soil organisms.},

  abstract = {Molecular identification of micro- and macroorganisms based on nuclear markers has revolutionized our understanding of their taxonomy, phylogeny and ecology. Today, research on the diversity of eukaryotes in global ecosystems heavily relies on nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) markers. Here, we present the research community-curated reference database EUKARYOME for nuclear ribosomal 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA markers for all eukaryotes, including metazoans (animals), protists, fungi and plants. It is particularly useful for the identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as it bridges the four commonly used molecular markers---ITS1, ITS2, 18S V4--V5 and 28S D1--D2 subregions. The key benefits of this database over other annotated reference sequence databases are that it is not restricted to certain taxonomic groups and it includes all rRNA markers. EUKARYOME also offers a number of reference long-read sequences that are derived from (meta)genomic and (meta)barcoding---a unique feature that can be used for taxonomic identification and chimera control of third-generation, long-read, high-throughput sequencing data. Taxonomic assignments of rRNA genes in the database are verified based on phylogenetic approaches. The reference datasets are available in multiple formats from the project homepage, http://www.eukaryome.org.},

While fungal pathogens are the largest group of plant pathogens, other important plant pathogens include bacteria, protists, chromists, nematodes, and even plants. Although this wide variety of pathogens share many aspects in epidemiology and management, here we deal only with fungal plant pathogens. The economic importance of fungal plant pathogens in the production of food, feed, materials, and ornamentals is undisputed (1). Direct costs include yield loss and use of resistant cultivars or pesticides. Indirect costs include the inability to grow certain crops or cultivars at a given location. Inspection and quarantine protocols to prevent the dispersal of pathogens (2) are indirect costs that are rarely taken into account. In contrast, as will be shown in this review, plant pathogens in nature are regarded as crucial contributors to the maintenance of biodiversity, similar to the role major animal predators play in wildlife.},

Here, we evaluate if, and to what extend, dual-purpose wetlands benefit local and regional diversity of agricultural landscapes. We analysed composition and {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, and {$\gamma$} diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among dual-purpose wetlands in an agricultural region in southwest Sweden in relation to local (water quality, wetland morphology, succession stage, proximity to other aquatic habitats) and landscape parameters (regional connectivity, wetland density). Diversity of mature agricultural ponds was used as a standard to evaluate the value of dual-purpose wetlands. Dual-purpose wetlands sustained {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, and {$\gamma$} diversity similar to that of natural lentic water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the region and elsewhere. Over 80\% of the overall species richness was attributed to {$\beta$} diversity, and each created wetland contributed to overall species accumulation. Ecosystem parameters explained 19\% of the compositional variation among assemblages, but were only marginally related to diversity. Wetland density promoted {$\alpha$} and {$\gamma$} diversity, while spatial heterogeneity ({$\beta$}) remained equally high, independent of wetland density. Our results indicate that catchment-scale wetland creation for simultaneous retention and diversity purposes benefits the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes, particularly if the density of aquatic habitats is increased by at least 30\%.},

  abstract = {The phylum Rozellomycota has been proposed for a group of early-branching holomycotan lineages representing obligate parasites and hyperparasites of zoosporic fungi, oomycotes or phytoplankton. Given their predominantly intracellular lifestyle, rozellids are typically known from environmental ribosomal DNA data, except for the well-studied Rozella species. To date, the phylogenetic relationship between rozellids and microsporidians (Microsporidia) is not fully understood and most reliable hypotheses are based on phylogenomic analyses that incorporate the only publicly available rozellid genome of Rozella allomycis. Here, we provide genomic data of three new rozellid lineages obtained by single-cell sequencing from environmental samples and show with a phylogenomic approach that rozellids form a monophyletic group that is sister to microsporidians, corroborating the previously proposed phylum Rozellomycota. Whereas no mitochondrial genes coding for the respiratory Complex I could be found, we discovered a gene coding for a nucleotide phosphate transporter in one of the three draft genomes. The scattered absence of Complex I genes and scattered presence of nucleotide transporter genes across diverse microsporidian and rozellid lineages suggest that these adaptations to a parasitic lifestyle, which reduce the parasite's capability to synthesize ATP but enables it to steal ATP from its host, evolved independently in microsporidians and rozellids.},

  abstract = {The spatial insurance hypothesis predicts that intermediate rates of dispersal between patches in a metacommunity allow species to track favourable conditions, preserving diversity and stabilizing biomass at local and regional scales. However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2{$^\circ$}C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.},

A region of approximately 500 bp, spanning two introns and 133 codons, was PCR-amplified and sequenced from isolates of Lentinula spp., Pleurotus spp., and several related taxa. Intronic regions were highly polymorphic among Pleurotus spp. and between Pleurotus and Lentinula. Two L. lateritia isolates were 99\% similar to each other and 80.7\%--82.8\% similar to Pleurotus species. Sufficient polymorphism also existed within protein coding regions to differentiate among species of Pleurotus. Lentinus tigrinus and Ganoderma lucidum shared a unique evolutionary lineage. The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for an ancient gene duplication among ascomycete genes. The basidiomycete lineage is attached at a point near the Aspergillus nidulans BenA/Colletotrichum graminicola Tub2 cluster, after the divergence of the gene duplication. The existing level of variation among the fungi examined indicates that this gene will be useful in phylogenetic investigations of higher order relationships among broader groups of fungi.},

Alpine regions are sensitive to climate change, and the importance of changes in fungal community composition along altitudinal gradients in alpine regions is hotly debated.Materials and methodsWe used 454 pyrosequencing approaches to investigate the fungal communities at 1600, 2300, 2800, 3000, and 3900 m above sea level along an altitudinal gradient on Mount Gongga.Results and discussionThe results showed that Agaricomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes are the dominant classes at all sampling sites. Operational taxonomic unit richness decreased with increasing altitude, and the fungal communities were clustered into three groups that corresponded to altitudes of, i.e., 1600, 2300, and above 2800 m. The evenness of fungi was not significantly correlated with altitude, whereas beta diversities were significantly correlated with altitude. The distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel test indicated that the composition of fungal assemblages was mostly driven by altitude and temperature.ConclusionsOur results indicated that ecological processes possibly related to altitude and temperature play an important role in structuring fungal biodiversity along the elevational gradient. Our results highlight that different microbes may respond differently to environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Maasai and Kurya form two main communities around the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania which are mainly pastoralists. Changing climate to excessive drought, have recently forced them to start practicing subsistence farming which is severely affected by wild animals. This study explored status of the folk taxonomy and uses of mushrooms in the two communities as a pave way for possibilities of introducing mushroom cultivation, an alternative crop which is hardly affected by wild animals. Folk taxonomy and use mushrooms by the Kurya and Maasai communities were investigated. Information was collected by face to face interviews with 150 individuals in 6 selected villages. Using descriptive statistics by Statistic Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 17.0, the demographic characteristics of informants were evaluated and cross relationships with the recorded data were analysed. Kurya are mycophilic with 94\% of the informants recognizing utilization of the wild mushroom either as foodstuff or as tonics while the Maasai are mycophobic with 99\% being unaware of the edibility of mushroom although 28\% recognized mushrooms as tonic. For both communities, the knowledge of mushroom utilization and folk taxonomy increased with age of the informants, while it decreases with formal education level of the informants which imply that the basis of knowledge is mainly traditional. Comparing the two communities, the Maasai use mushrooms only for medicinal purposes and never sought them for food while the Kurya were well knowledgeable on the edibility and folk classification especially the Termitomyces species. Characters used in folkal taxonomy included color and size of the basidiomata, shape and size of the pseudorrhiza, habitats and edibility information. A new use of ascospores whereby they anaesthaesia bees during honey harvesting was discovered, and mushroom cultivation was widely welcomed (94.7\%) as an alternative crop which is rarely affected by wild animals. In order to salvage a noted tremendous decrease of knowledge in mushroom utilization and folk taxonomy from vanishing, there is a need to document it throughout, and incorporate it in lower levels of our education system. Mushroom cultivation may possibly be the best alternative crop for the two communities thus should be advocated for improving livelihood and reduce human wildlife conflicts. The new recorded use of ascospores to anaesthaesia the bees during honey harvesting should be exploited and scaled up for sustainable integrated bee keeping and mushroom farming.},

  abstract = {This study documents the use of a wild edible mushroom (WEM) in Tanzania rural areas and assesses its significance as a source of healthy food and income for the disadvantaged rural dwellers. The data was gathered through local market surveys in order to conventionally identify different common WEM taxa using a semi-structured interview and it involved 160 people comprised of WEM hunters, traders and consumers. The collected data covered the information on where, how, when and who was the principal transmitter of the mycological knowledge learned and the general information on their market and values. Results show that mushroom gathering is gender oriented, dominated by women (76.25\%) whereas men account for 23.75\%. Women possess vast knowledge of mushroom folk taxonomy, biology and ecology and are therefore the principal knowledge transmitters. It was also found that learning about WEM began at an early age and is family tradition based. The knowledge is acquired and imparted by practices and is mostly transmitted vertically through family dissemination. The results also revealed that 75 WEM species belong to 14 families sold in fresh or dry form. The common sold species belonged to the family Cantharellaceae (19) followed by Rusullaceae (16) and Lyophyllaceae (13), respectively. Collectors residing near miombo woodland may harvest 20--30 buckets (capacity 20 liters) and the business may earn a person about \$400--900 annually. This finding envisages the purposeful strengthening of WEM exploitation, which would contribute significantly in boosting the rural income/economy and reduce conflicts between community and forest conservers. The activity would also provide alternative employment, improve food security to rural disadvantaged groups especially women and old people hence improve their livelihood.},

We present a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina data sets that can identify independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97\% similarity OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S tags differing by as little as one nucleotide (99.2\% similarity). A comparative analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100\% sequence identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into factors shaping community assembly.},

  abstract = {Summary Joint species distribution models (JSDM) are increasingly used to analyse community ecology data. Recent progress with JSDMs has provided ecologists with new tools for estimating species associations (residual co-occurrence patterns after accounting for environmental niches) from large data sets, as well as for increasing the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs) by accounting for such associations. Yet, one critical limitation of JSDMs developed thus far is that they assume constant species associations. However, in real ecological communities, the direction and strength of interspecific interactions are likely to be different under different environmental conditions. In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of present JSDMs by allowing species associations covary with measured environmental covariates. To estimate environmental-dependent species associations, we utilize a latent variable structure, where the factor loadings are modelled as a linear regression to environmental covariates. We illustrate the performance of the statistical framework with both simulated and real data. Our results show that JSDMs perform substantially better in inferring environmental-dependent species associations than single SDMs, especially with sparse data. Furthermore, JSDMs consistently overperform SDMs in terms of predictive power for generating predictions that account for environment-dependent biotic associations. We implemented the statistical framework as a MATLAB package, which includes tools both for model parameterization as well as for post-processing of results, particularly for addressing whether and how species associations depend on the environmental conditions. Our statistical framework provides a new tool for ecologists who wish to investigate from non-manipulative observational community data the dependency of interspecific interactions on environmental context. Our method can be applied to answer the fundamental questions in community ecology about how species? interactions shift in changing environmental conditions, as well as to predict future changes of species? interactions in response to global change.},

Recently developed joint species distribution models can deal with numerous species efficiently, while explicitly accounting for spatial structure in the data. However, their applicability is generally limited to relatively small spatial data sets because of their severe computational scaling as the number of spatial locations increases. In this work, we propose a practical alleviation of this scalability constraint for joint species modeling by exploiting two spatial-statistics techniques that facilitate the analysis of large spatial data sets: Gaussian predictive process and nearest-neighbor Gaussian process. We devised an efficient Gibbs posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian model fitting that allows us to analyze community data sets consisting of hundreds of species sampled from up to hundreds of thousands of spatial units. The performance of these methods is demonstrated using an extensive plant data set of 30,955 spatial units as a case study. We provide an implementation of the presented methods as an extension to the hierarchical modeling of species communities framework.},

  abstract = {Abstract Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM) is becoming an increasingly popular statistical method for analysing data in community ecology. Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) is a general and flexible framework for fitting JSDMs. HMSC allows the integration of community ecology data with data on environmental covariates, species traits, phylogenetic relationships and the spatio-temporal context of the study, providing predictive insights into community assembly processes from non-manipulative observational data of species communities. The full range of functionality of HMSC has remained restricted to Matlab users only. To make HMSC accessible to the wider community of ecologists, we introduce Hmsc 3.0, a user-friendly r implementation. We illustrate the use of the package by applying Hmsc 3.0 to a range of case studies on real and simulated data. The real data consist of bird counts in a spatio-temporally structured dataset, environmental covariates, species traits and phylogenetic relationships. Vignettes on simulated data involve single-species models, models of small communities, models of large species communities and models for large spatial data. We demonstrate the estimation of species responses to environmental covariates and how these depend on species traits, as well as the estimation of residual species associations. We demonstrate how to construct and fit models with different types of random effects, how to examine MCMC convergence, how to examine the explanatory and predictive powers of the models, how to assess parameter estimates and how to make predictions. We further demonstrate how Hmsc 3.0 can be applied to normally distributed data, count data and presence?absence data. The package, along with the extended vignettes, makes JSDM fitting and post-processing easily accessible to ecologists familiar with r.},

  abstract = {Summary Cellular ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. Many eukaryotic species have two (diploid) or more than two (polyploid) sets of chromosomes (1). These diploid and polyploid states are often the result of ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) or hybridization events that occurred throughout the evolution of plants, animals, and fungi (2 -- 4). Ploidy changes also occur during the development of many organisms and can vary within different tissues of the same organism and between individuals of the same species. For example, ploidy changes occur during the sexual cycle of eukaryotes, from haploid gametes to diploid somatic cells. Additionally, some cells continue to increase in ploidy during development, resulting in somatic tissues that have a mixture of diploid and polyploid cells, including human hepatocytes and megakaryocytes (5 -- 7). These ongoing, developmentally programmed changes in ploidy are important for viability and are beneficial to many organisms (8), but the mechanisms controlling ploidy and the physiological significance of each ploidy level are not well characterized.},

  abstract = {The kingdom Fungi is estimated to include 1.5 million or more species, playing key roles as decomposers, mutualists, and parasites in every biome on the earth. To comprehensively understand the diversity and ecology of this huge kingdom, DNA barcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat has been regarded as a prerequisite procedure. By extensively surveying ITS sequences in public databases, we designed new ITS primers with improved coverage across diverse taxonomic groups of fungi compared to existing primers. An in silico analysis based on public sequence databases indicated that the newly designed primers matched 99\% of ascomycete and basidiomycete ITS taxa (species, subspecies or varieties), causing little taxonomic bias toward either fungal group. Two of the newly designed primers could inhibit the amplification of plant sequences and would enable the selective investigation of fungal communities in mycorrhizal associations, soil, and other types of environmental samples. Optimal PCR conditions for the primers were explored in an in vitro investigation. The new primers developed in this study will provide a basis for ecological studies on the diversity and community structures of fungi in the era of massive DNA sequencing.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial plants host phylogenetically and functionally diverse groups of below-ground microbes, whose community structure controls plant growth/survival in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the processes by which whole root-associated microbiomes are organized is one of the major challenges in ecology and plant science. We here report that diverse root-associated fungi can form highly compartmentalized networks of coexistence within host roots and that the structure of the fungal symbiont communities can be partitioned into semi-discrete types even within a single host plant population. Illumina sequencing of root-associated fungi in a monodominant south beech forest revealed that the network representing symbiont--symbiont co-occurrence patterns was compartmentalized into clear modules, which consisted of diverse functional groups of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. Consequently, terminal roots of the plant were colonized by either of the two largest fungal species sets (represented by Oidiodendron or Cenococcum). Thus, species-rich root microbiomes can have alternative community structures, as recently shown in the relationships between human gut microbiome type (i.e. `enterotype') and host individual health. This study also shows an analytical framework for pinpointing network hubs in symbiont--symbiont networks, leading to the working hypothesis that a small number of microbial species organize the overall root--microbiome dynamics.},

  abstract = {The microsporidian genera Nosema and Vairimorpha comprise a clade described from insects. Currently the genus Nosema is defined as having a dimorphic life cycle characterized by diplokaryotic stages and diplosporoblastic sporogony with two functionally and morphologically distinct spore types (``early'' or ``primary'' and ``environmental''). The Vairimorpha life cycle, in addition to a Nosema-type diplokaryotic sporogony, includes an octosporoblastic sporogony producing eight uninucleate spores (octospores) within a sporophorous vesicle. Molecular phylogeny, however, has clearly demonstrated that the genera Nosema and Vairimorpha, characterized by the absence or presence of uninucleate octospores, respectively, represent two polyphyletic taxa, and that octosporogony is turned on and off frequently within taxa, depending on environmental factors such as host species and rearing temperature. In addition, recent studies have shown that both branches of the Vairimorpha-Nosema clade contain species that are uninucleate throughout their life cycle. The SSU rRNA gene sequence data reveal two distinct clades, those closely related to Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species for the genus Vairimorpha, and those closely related to Nosema bombycis, the type species for the genus Nosema. Here, we redefine the two genera, giving priority to molecular character states over those observed at the developmental, structural or ultrastructural levels and present a list of revised species designations. Using this approach, a series of species are renamed (combination novum) and members of two genera, Rugispora and Oligosporidium, are reassigned to Vairimorpha because of their phylogenetic position. Moreover, the family Nosematidae is redefined and includes the genera Nosema and Vairimorpha comprising a monophyletic lineage of Microsporidia.},

  abstract = {Fungal fruit-bodies are an important economic resource both for recreational pickers and commercial markets. The broad interest in forest fungi and mushrooms has motivated attempts to develop appropriate silvicultural methods able to preserve and improve mushroom yields. Defining best practices for the sustainability and profitability of forest fungal resources is the main aim of `mycosilviculture'. However, the difficulty of monitoring and studying such a cryptic kingdom (i.e., fungi) under real forest conditions has led to rather scattered scientific knowledge of the effects of forest management regimes and silvicultural operations on wild mushroom resources. Here, we review the current scientific literature regarding the influence of (i) stand characteristics, i.e. stand age, stand density, canopy cover and tree species composition, (ii) silvicultural practices and (iii) other management-related disturbances affecting the yield of wild epigeous mushrooms, with the aim of systematizing existing scientific knowledge and identifying gaps in knowledge in order to suggest future lines of research. Most of the research in the field of mycosilviculture to date has focused on ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, which include the majority of wild commercial mushrooms. The main findings from the literature indicate that forest management practices, by modifying stand characteristics and microclimatic conditions, can influence wild mushroom occurrence and productivity, both positively and negatively, depending on the specific fungal ecological needs, reproductive strategies, forest type and management regime. Further research efforts relating to all aspects of the interaction between forest management, fungal ecology and mushroom production are needed: in particular, additional research efforts should be devoted to understanding mushroom yield dynamics in uneven-aged and mixed forests and evaluating the effects of regeneration methods on fungal communities.},

  abstract = {Here, we introduce ezRAD, a novel strategy for restriction site--associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment, and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits, which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of nonmodel organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

  abstract = {Summary The Opisthokonta are a eukaryotic supergroup divided in two main lineages: animals and related protistan taxa, and fungi and their allies [1, 2]. There is a great diversity of lifestyles and morphologies among unicellular opisthokonts, from free-living phagotrophic flagellated bacterivores and filopodiated amoebas to cell-walled osmotrophic parasites and saprotrophs. However, these characteristics do not group into monophyletic assemblages, suggesting rampant convergent evolution within Opisthokonta. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a new phylogenomic dataset via sequencing 12 new strains of protists. Phylogenetic relationships among opisthokonts revealed independent origins of filopodiated amoebas in two lineages, one related to fungi and the other to animals. Moreover, we observed that specialized osmotrophic lifestyles evolved independently in fungi and protistan relatives of animals, indicating convergent evolution. We therefore analyzed the evolution of two key fungal characters in Opisthokonta, the flagellum and chitin synthases. Comparative analyses of the flagellar toolkit showed a previously unnoticed flagellar apparatus in two close relatives of animals, the filasterean Ministeria vibrans and Corallochytrium limacisporum. This implies that at least four different opisthokont lineages secondarily underwent flagellar simplification. Analysis of the evolutionary history of chitin synthases revealed significant expansions in both animals and~fungi, and also in the Ichthyosporea and C.~limacisporum, a group of cell-walled animal relatives. This indicates that the last opisthokont common ancestor had a complex toolkit of chitin synthases that was differentially retained in extant lineages. Thus, our data provide evidence for convergent evolution of specialized lifestyles in close relatives of animals and fungi from a generalist ancestor.},

Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed-species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small-seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.},

In this paper, we show that the convergence proof of AMSGrad is also problematic. Concretely, the problem in the convergence proof of AMSGrad is in handling the hyper-parameters, treating them as equal while they are not. This is also the neglected issue in the convergence proof of Adam. We provide an explicit counter-example of a simple convex optimization setting to show this neglected issue. Depending on manipulating the hyper-parameters, we present various fixes for this issue. We provide a new convergence proof for AMSGrad as the first fix. We also propose a new version of AMSGrad called AdamX as another fix. Our experiments on the benchmark dataset also support our theoretical results.},

Seedling growth was further enhanced by combining inoculation with fertilization.

  abstract = {A 4-year monitoring of 16 eutrophic peri-urban ponds located in the southeastern periphery of Brussels has shown that different aquatic plants have different interrelationship with phytoplankton. Extensive submerged macrophytic vegetation has shown the strongest effect on phytoplankton biomass and composition and seems to be crucial for the maintenance of the clear-water state through its capacity to buffer the effects of nutrient enrichment. Restoration of submerged macrophytes seems to be essential for successful biomanipulation of eutrophic ponds. Biomanipulation induced revegetation with submerged macrophytes resulted in the restoration of the clear-water state in the two biomanipulated ponds. Fish removal not accompanied with the restoration of submerged macrophytes in the third biomanipulated pond did not lead to the decrease in phytoplankton biomass. The removal of submerged macrophytes from a clear-water pond invariably led to a shift towards the turbid state often accompanied with cyanobacterial bloom formation. Profuse growth of filamentous green algae also had a negative effect on phytoplankton growth, albeit less strong than that of submerged macrophytes. Floating-leaved plants did not show a significant effect on phytoplankton biomass outside their stands.},

  abstract = {Sequence analysis is the primary and simplest approach to discover structural, functional and evolutionary details of related proteins. All the alignment based approaches of sequence analysis make use of amino acid substitution matrices, and the accuracy of the results largely depends on the type of scoring matrices used to perform alignment tasks. An amino acid substitution matrix is a 20\,{\texttimes}\,20 matrix in which the individual elements encapsulate the rates at which each of the 20 amino acid residues in proteins are substituted by other amino acid residues over time. In contrast to most globular/ordered proteins whose amino acids composition is considered as standard, there are several classes of proteins (e.g., transmembrane proteins) in which certain types of amino acid (e.g., hydrophobic residues) are enriched. These compositional differences among various classes of proteins are manifested in their underlying residue substitution frequencies. Therefore, each of the compositionally distinct class of proteins or protein segments should be studied using specific scoring matrices that reflect their distinct residue substitution pattern. In this review, we describe the development and application of various substitution scoring matrices peculiar to proteins with standard and biased compositions. Along with most commonly used standard matrices (PAM, BLOSUM, MD and VTML) that act as default parameters in various homologs search and alignment tools, different substitution scoring matrices specific to compositionally distinct class of proteins are discussed in detail.},

Until recently, however, little was known about its natural ecology. Now, because of greatly increased sampling of C. elegans from the wild, we are learning more about its life outside the laboratory (2). In particular, it has become clear that C. elegans and other Caenorhabditis nematodes are commonly infected by microsporidia in the wild (3 -- 5). Microsporidia comprise a phylum of over 1,400 species of fungal-related parasites that can infect nearly all animal hosts (6 -- 8), so it is perhaps no surprise that these pathogens commonly infect the nematode C. elegans.},

  abstract = {Conventional marker-based genotyping platforms are widely available, but not without their limitations. In this context, we developed Sequence-Based Genotyping (SBG), a technology for simultaneous marker discovery and co-dominant scoring, using next-generation sequencing. SBG offers users several advantages including a generic sample preparation method, a highly robust genome complexity reduction strategy to facilitate de novo marker discovery across entire genomes, and a uniform bioinformatics workflow strategy to achieve genotyping goals tailored to individual species, regardless of the availability of a reference sequence. The most distinguishing features of this technology are the ability to genotype any population structure, regardless whether parental data is included, and the ability to co-dominantly score SNP markers segregating in populations. To demonstrate the capabilities of SBG, we performed marker discovery and genotyping in Arabidopsis thaliana and lettuce, two plant species of diverse genetic complexity and backgrounds. Initially we obtained 1,409 SNPs for arabidopsis, and 5,583 SNPs for lettuce. Further filtering of the SNP dataset produced over 1,000 high quality SNP markers for each species. We obtained a genotyping rate of 201.2 genotypes/SNP and 58.3 genotypes/SNP for arabidopsis (n = 222 samples) and lettuce (n = 87 samples), respectively. Linkage mapping using these SNPs resulted in stable map configurations. We have therefore shown that the SBG approach presented provides users with the utmost flexibility in garnering high quality markers that can be directly used for genotyping and downstream applications. Until advances and costs will allow for routine whole-genome sequencing of populations, we expect that sequence-based genotyping technologies such as SBG will be essential for genotyping of model and non-model genomes alike.},

  abstract = {DNA metabarcoding offers new perspectives, especially with regard to the high-throughput identification and diagnostics of pathogens. Microsporidia are an example of widely distributed, opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms in which molecular identification is important for both environmental research and clinical diagnostics. We have developed a method for parallel detection of both microsporidian infection and the host species. We designed new primer sets: one specific for the classical Microsporidia (targeting the hypervariable V5 region of small subunit [ssu] rDNA), and a second one targeting a shortened fragment of the COI gene (standard metazoan DNA-barcode); both markers are well suited for next generation sequencing. Analysis of the ssu rDNA data set representing 607 microsporidian species (120 genera) indicated that the V5 region enables identification of {$>$}98\% species in the data set (596/607). To test the method, we used microsporidians that infect mosquitoes in natural populations. Using mini-COI data, all field-collected mosquitoes were unambiguously assigned to seven species; among them almost 60\% of specimens were positive for at least 11 different microsporidian species, including a new microsporidian ssu rDNA sequence (Microsporidium sp. PL01). Phylogenetic analysis showed that this species belongs to one of the two main clades in the Terresporidia. We found a high rate of microsporidian co-infections (9.4\%). The numbers of sequence reads for the operational taxonomic units suggest that the occurrence of Nosema spp. in co-infections could benefit them; however, this observation should be retested using a more intensive host sampling. Our results show that DNA barcoding is a rapid and cost-effective method for deciphering sample diversity in greater resolution, including the hidden biodiversity that may be overlooked using classical methodology.},

  abstract = {Micro-organisms play critical roles in many important biogeochemical processes in the Earth's biosphere. However, understanding and characterizing the functional capacity of microbial communities are still difficult due to the extremely diverse and often uncultivable nature of most micro-organisms. In this study, we developed a new functional gene array, GeoChip 4, for analysing the functional diversity, composition, structure, metabolic potential/activity and dynamics of microbial communities. GeoChip 4 contained approximately 82~000 probes covering 141~995 coding sequences from 410 functional gene families related to microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulphur (S), and phosphorus (P) cycling, energy metabolism, antibiotic resistance, metal resistance/reduction, organic remediation, stress responses, bacteriophage and virulence. A total of 173 archaeal, 4138 bacterial, 404 eukaryotic and 252 viral strains were targeted, providing the ability to analyse targeted functional gene families of micro-organisms included in all four domains. Experimental assessment using different amounts of DNA suggested that as little as 500~ng environmental DNA was required for good hybridization, and the signal intensities detected were well correlated with the DNA amount used. GeoChip 4 was then applied to study the effect of long-term warming on soil microbial communities at a Central Oklahoma site, with results indicating that microbial communities respond to long-term warming by enriching carbon degradation, nutrient cycling (nitrogen and phosphorous) and stress response gene families. To the best of our knowledge, GeoChip 4 is the most comprehensive functional gene array for microbial community analysis.},

  abstract = {The term beta diversity has been used to refer to a wide variety of phenomena. Although all of these encompass some kind of compositional heterogeneity between places, many are not related to each other in any predictable way. The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called a beta component of diversity into a common conceptual framework, and to explain what each of them measures. In this first part, the focus is on defining beta diversity. This involves deciding what diversity is and how the observed total or gamma diversity ({$\gamma$}) is partitioned into alpha ({$\alpha$}) and beta ({$\beta$}) components. Several different definitions of ``beta diversity'' that result from these decisions have been used in the ecological literature. True beta diversity is obtained when the total effective number of species in a dataset (true gamma diversity{$\gamma$}) is multiplicatively partitioned into the effective number of species per compositionally distinct virtual sampling unit (true alpha diversity{$\alpha$}d) and the effective number of such compositional units ({$\beta$}Md={$\gamma$}/{$\alpha$}d). All true diversities quantify the effective number of types of entities. Because the other variants of ``beta diversity'' that have been used by ecologists quantify other phenomena, an alternative nomenclature is proposed here for the seven most popular beta components: regional-to-local diversity ratio, two-way diversity ratio, absolute effective species turnover (=regional diversity excess), Whittaker's effective species turnover, proportional effective species turnover, regional entropy excess and regional variance excess. In the second part of the review, the focus will be on how to quantify these phenomena in practice. This involves deciding how the sampling units that contribute to total diversity are selected, and whether the entity that is quantified is all of ``beta diversity'', a specific part of ``beta diversity'', the rate of change in ``beta diversity'' in relation to a given external factor, or something else.},

  abstract = {Hunger and starvation in sub-Saharan Africa have lasted too long. But Africans are not consigned to a lifetime of food insecurity. The knowledge, technology and resources for closing the food security deficit are available today, and breakthroughs will continue to emerge from research and development. But no one believes it is possible simply to distribute better seeds and more fertilizer to African farmers and then to walk away. Nor will economic growth alone solve the problem. The failures that add up to food insecurity are pervasive, from agricultural, health, education and nutrition policies to research, extension services, sanitation, local government, commerce and transport. An effective response to a challenge this broad cannot be narrowed to a single intervention, discipline or institutional mandate. It will take a coordinated response across sectors. This Africa Human Development Report, the first, argues that sustainable increases in agricultural productivity protect food entitlements--- the ability of people to access food. Furthering human development requires nutrition policies that unleash the potential of today's and future generations. Also, communities must be resilient enough to absorb shocks and have the power to make decisions about their own lives. Food security for human development For too long the face of sub-Saharan Africa has been one of dehumanizing hunger. More than one in four Africans is undernourished, and food insecurity--- the inability to consistently acquire enough calories and nutrients for a healthy and productive life--- is pervasive. The spectre of famine, which has virtually disappeared elsewhere in the world, continues to haunt parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Famines grab headlines, but chronic food insecurity and malnutrition are more insidious, often silent, daily calamities for millions of Africans. Yet sub-Saharan Africa has ample agricultural land, plenty of water and a generally favourable climate for growing food. And in the last 10 years many African countries posted world-beating economic growth rates and became among the fastest movers on the Human Development Index. With these endowments and important economic and social achievements, why is the region still food insecure? These two jarring paradoxes are the point of departure for this Report. The Report argues that sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and better nutrition are the drivers of food-secure growth and human development. The argument is straightforward: more productive agriculture will build food security by increasing food availability and lowering food prices, thus improving access. Higher productivity can also raise the incomes of millions of smallholder farmers, elevating living standards and improving health and education, thus expanding people's capabilities. Through science, technology and the diffusion of innovation greater agricultural productivity can also enable better stewardship of the environment. Sound nutrition links food security to human development. Well-nourished people exercise their freedoms and capabilities in different domains--- the essence of human development--- and, completing the cycle, will be inclined to demand food security from their leaders. The human development approach focuses on entitlements and capabilities. Food security should thus be leveraged by empowering people to make their own choices and by building resilience in the face of shocks. That means preserving people's food entitlements--- the income, market structures, institutional rules and governance that enable the poor to buy and trade food in fair markets. It also means reinforcing essential human capabilities in health and education. Focusing policies on these four areas--- agricultural productivity, nutrition, resilience and empowerment--- can unleash a dynamic virtuous cycle of food security and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa still trails the world in human development, but the quickening pace of change and the new economic vitality in the region offer grounds for renewed (if guarded) optimism. Conditions in sub-Saharan Africa today Sub-Saharan Africa has abundant agricultural resources. But shamefully, in all corners of the region, millions of people remain hungry and malnourished--- the result of glaringly uneven local food production and distribution and chronically deficient diets, especially among the poorest. This is a daily violation of people's dignity, with many governments not fulfilling their basic responsibility of protecting their citizens from hunger. The chain of food security that runs from availability through access to use comes under constant stress in a region vulnerable to the impacts of erratic weather, volatile food prices, and conflict and violence. Agricultural productivity remains low--- much lower than in other regions. Many sub-Saharan African countries are net food importers and even depend on food aid during all-too-frequent humanitarian crises. Where food is available, millions cannot afford it or are prevented from buying or trading it by underdeveloped markets, poor roads, long distances to markets and high transport costs. Important as food availability and access are, food security is about still more. Proper use of food and good nutrition determine whether food security sustains human development. Malnutrition leads to illness and death--- as insufficient access to safe water, energy and sanitation combine with diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria in a lethal mix that perpetuates the problem. Hunger exacts a crippling toll on individuals and society alike. Poorly nourished children have weakened immune systems and die from communicable diseases that are ordinarily curable. Malnourishment in the first 1,000 days after conception can lead to irreparable damage to children's physical and mental development. Malnourished mothers are at greater risk of dying during childbirth or of delivering lowbirthweight babies who do not survive infancy. Infants that make it through childhood are more likely to suffer stunting that shortens their lives and to perpetuate the cycle of deprivation when those children in turn produce low-birthweight babies. Africans have been trapped by hunger for decades, with millions consuming staple foods deficient in the micronutrients needed to sustain child growth and adult productivity. Hunger also eviscerates society by increasing disease, mortality and disability. It inflates healthcare costs, reduces worker productivity and diminishes social and economic returns to education. It violates basic human dignity and damages self-esteem. Persistent challenges and emerging threats Misguided policies, weak institutions and failing markets are the deeper causes of sub-Saharan Africa's food insecurity. This tainted inheritance is most evident in households and communities, where unequal power relations trap vulnerable groups--- subsistence farmers, the landless poor, many women and children--- in a vicious cycle of deprivation, food insecurity and low human development. For decades the policies of national governments and international institutions neglected sub-Saharan Africa's rural and agricultural development in favour of urban populations. Their damaging legacies include ineffective postcolonial industrialization plans that exhausted development resources, leaving agriculture behind. Structural adjustment programmes aimed to close budget gaps but instead created large human development deficits, especially among the vulnerable poor, and skewed allocations of national revenue and foreign aid that overlooked agriculture and nutrition. Despite some improvements since the mid- 1990s, many African governments continue to burden domestic agriculture with high, arbitrary taxes while bestowing subsidies, incentives and macroeconomic support on other sectors. Meanwhile, many developed countries have moved the other way, heavily subsidizing agriculture long after its role as a development driver has passed, giving their farmers a tremendous advantage in international trade. Sub-Saharan Africa's smallholder farmers, sidelined by biased policies and squeezed by failing markets, long ago gave up struggling to compete against the world's most formidable agricultural systems. Breaking with the past, standing up to the vested interests of the privileged few and building institutions that rebalance power relations at all levels of society will require courageous citizens and dedicated leaders. Taking these steps is all the more pressing as new threats to the sustainability of sub-Saharan Africa's food systems have emerged. Demographic change, environmental pressure, and global and local climate change are profoundly reconfiguring the region's development options. These new challenges will be magnified by sub-Saharan Africa's rising population, almost 2 billion by 2050. Meeting the increasing demand for food will require substantially boosting food crop yields over the next half century and mitigating stresses put on agricultural production by climate change and current agricultural practices. Only sharp and sustainable increases in agricultural productivity will enable food production, incomes and livelihoods to keep pace with these developments. Raising agricultural productivity Local agricultural capacity is the bedrock of food security in sub-Saharan Africa, a truth so apparent it would hardly require stating had it not been so consistently slighted. Agriculture determines the availability of food, the first link in the chain of food security. For most Africans, especially the poor, agriculture is also the wellspring of income and work, core elements of human development. In turn, earnings and employment bolster food security by enabling access to sufficient quantities of nutritious food. Beyond these crucial and mutually reinforcing effects, agriculture also shapes how--- and how sustainably--- the region uses much of its land and water. Despite agriculture's importance, it has performed below its potential for generations in sub-Saharan Africa, neglected by government policies and held back by low farm productivity. Following age-old practices, African smallholder farmers have long survived by growing crops on reclaimed forest and grazing land or by recycling plots without replenishing their nutrients. Production increases have come from expanding cultivated land area, not from making farming more efficient. The scope for further area expansion is diminishing, and farmers now need to produce more food for each unit of land, with the help of modern technology. Productivity increases will generate farm employment; decent wages, including those for unskilled labour; and income for rural communities. Boosting productivity requires more fertilizers and seeds, stronger research and development, and a more coordinated and responsive extension system staffed by experts versed in the behaviours and habitats of local farming communities. ``Smart subsidies,'' which encourage smallholder farmers to shift to high-yield crop varieties without saddling the state with long-term costs, can energize food production and markets. Research that embraces local farmers' knowledge as part of the technology for improving yields can deliver results where blinkered laboratory designs have failed. Encouraging smallholder farmers to adopt new inputs begins with understanding their resistance to change. Policy-making and institutional research should focus on varietal options for health and nutrition. Multidisciplinary knowledge is required to develop environmentally sustainable farm technologies. Modern agricultural technology can deliver solutions that not only boost yields but also economize on inputs, making fertilizer and water use more environment friendly. Creating and diffusing science and innovation require more collaboration among breeders, researchers and farmers. Irrigation presents a long-term challenge for sub-Saharan Africa. Most countries have to make large investments in irrigation methods designed for sustainable and employment-intensive water management. But not all parts of the region need irrigation. Many semihumid and humid zones have enough moisture to make other means of water control feasible. Better market access can also boost yields. When farmers can transport their surpluses quickly and cheaply to points of sale or storage, they have incentives to increase production. This will take market development policies, transport regulation reforms to introduce competition, and substantial investment in rural roads, information technology, railways and warehouses. Access to credit and insurance through innovative schemes can lower the risks of adopting new inputs and motivate farmers to experiment with new varieties. Attracting young Africans to participate in agriculture will bring new energy and ideas into its development. Technology and innovation can create enticing and profitable openings, enterprises and occupations along the value chain of a sector that young people have come to denigrate as a backwater. Connecting three assets--- a bulging youth population, advances in innovation and the promise of agricultural development--- is a natural way forward for many countries. Higher agricultural productivity can deliver a triple dividend--- sustained food security, higher human development and lower pressure on land and water. But governments will have to rethink their priorities in order to pay for the required investments. Self-defeating policies that put guns before bread, cities before farms and fatty foods before nutrition will not measure up. Adequate funding for agricultural research and development and for effective regional collaboration on big-ticket investments in land and water control will yield a richer harvest for sub-Saharan Africa than will sowing conflicts with bullets or converting continental breadbaskets into fuel tanks. From food security to human development through nutrition Too often the news from sub-Saharan Africa is easy to predict: famine and humanitarian food crises on the front page, volatile international food prices in the business section and numbing images of emaciated children in the magazine supplement. But while hunger dominates the African narrative, malnutrition--- its silent accomplice--- seldom makes headlines. Malnutrition is an obstacle to human development, inflicting irreversible damage on individuals early in life and imposing large economic and social losses on countries for years to come. Malnutrition is a plague on childhood. It can span generations in the form of hidden hunger, a lifesapping inheritance of nutrient deficiency resulting from past practices of eating low-quality foods. But fortifying these staples can preserve their place in traditional diets. Improving micronutrient intake is among the most effective--- and cost-effective--- ways to combat malnutrition. Concentrating on a handful of nutrients (vitamin A, iodine, iron and zinc) can leverage large human development returns from a small input--- one of society's most efficient development investments. Many of the most critical and cost-effective nutrition interventions are not expensive. One is empowering women, a far-reaching way to help households break the cycle of intergenerational deprivation. When women have less say in decisions than men do, nutrition suffers, household food security deteriorates and access to healthcare lags. When women have more influence on household choices, child nutrition often prospers. Well-nourished people are more productive and more receptive to learning. Well-nourished children learn better and are more likely to live lives they value. Indeed, the importance of nutrition begins even before children are born: nutrition during gestation has long-term benefits for children's ability to learn and grow. Food science is uncovering new ways to improve the diets of the poor. Research on biofortification--- breeding nutrients into crops--- holds great promise because it focuses on the unprocessed food staples that poor people eat in large quantities every day. Biofortification implicitly targets its nutrient enrichment to low-income households that do not consume commercially fortified processed foods. While the technology has limits, it could give traditional African diets a major nutrition boost. Nutrition is affected by a range of circumstances--- from the political economy and seasonal and climate conditions to cultural and religious customs, the availability of health services and the level of household education, including knowledge of sound eating and health practices. Also in play are agricultural production and income, access to varied and nutritious foods, a sanitary environment and sufficient safe water and cooking fuel. A multidimensional challenge of this order demands a multisectoral nutrition strategy--- one with high-level government commitment, adequate resources and nutrition-sensitive interventions by the state, civil society, the private sector and the international community. Nutrition has to move up the policy agenda and down to households. Otherwise, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to incur the high costs to its citizens and societies of one of the region's most disabling deficits. Building resilience From field to table the supply of food in sub-Saharan Africa is fraught with risk. Shocks, cycles and trends threaten food security and livelihoods. Conflict, droughts, floods, food price spikes and other shocks inflict immediate hardship on the poorest and most vulnerable households and constrain future human development. And too often the damage is permanent. Cyclical or longer term stresses--- such as seasonal harvesting patterns that result in long ``hungry seasons'' between harvests, or creeping environmental degradation--- are slower moving and more predictable. But they devastate communities all the same--- especially those that cannot manage their exposure to hazards and protect their livelihoods. Stresses from population pressure are pervasive and growing. Preventing or relieving stresses before they undermine food systems requires action across multiple fronts--- from the environment to conflict resolution, market stability and women's empowerment. Long-term thinking requires lowering agriculture's contribution to climate change through policies that emphasize climate-smart practices. Ensuring that techniques to boost agricultural productivity are sustainable will allow farmers to adapt to climate change and to reap the benefits of nutrient-enriched soils today without adding to environmental stress. Action to curb conflicts in the region would reduce the frequency of food system collapses. Dampening the volatility of global food prices is a collective endeavour for the international community. But African countries have a large stake in backing a new global architecture for agriculture and food security based on better market access for food importers, fewer restrictions on exporters and less distortion in biofuel markets. Effective responses to rising demographic pressures on the food supply start with enlarging women's capabilities by improving their access to education, earnings and effective family planning services. Forward-looking measures can buffer food systems from stress--- or at least reduce the frequency and intensity of the most damaging strains. But crises happen, and poor communities must be ready to manage risks and cope with shocks. Social protection--- such as insurance, employment protection, food and cash-for-work programmes, food assistance, subsidies and social transfers--- can determine whether crisis-struck households survive or succumb. However, avoiding deterioration in food systems and mitigating the impacts of breakdowns are hardly progress. The most effective social protection policies raise returns to core productive assets--- in sub-Saharan Africa, labour and land--- and lift people out of poverty, reducing their need for social support and building their capacity to withstand recurring shocks. Linking social protection to measures that enhance farmers' access to technology, stabilize rural markets and commodity prices, and build up rural infrastructure can make farmers, households and markets more resilient. Empowerment, social justice and gender This Report shows that the basic right to food--- and the right to life itself--- is being violated in sub-Saharan Africa to an intolerable degree. Building a food secure continent requires transformative change--- change that will be most effective if accompanied by a shift of resources, capacities and decisions to smallholder farmers, poor communities and women. When women and other vulnerable groups gain a voice in the decisions affecting their lives and livelihoods, their capacity to produce, trade and use food is materially enhanced. Knowledge and organization are the keys to opening the public space. Information technology can put up-to-the-minute knowledge about market prices and conditions at farmers' fingertips, increasing their leverage, while cooperatives and producer associations can provide platforms for collective bargaining. When food market actors--- farmers, transporters, sellers and buyers--- communicate regularly and quickly, costs and transaction times fall and farmers' incomes tend to rise. High connectivity can make farmers better traders and markets more transparent. New inputs and farming techniques can liberate farmers from cycles of low productivity and poverty. But technology is double-edged. Misapplied, it dispossesses or marginalizes smallholder farmers. Science conducted far from where its results are used, and compartmentalized in water-tight disciplines, can lead to designs poorly suited to smallholder farms and local habitats. Participation and voice grow stronger when political, economic and social power is widely dispersed. Locally determined solutions are usually more sustainable than top-down decisions. Producer organizations amplify the political voice of farmers, reduce the costs of marketing inputs and outputs and provide a meeting point for collective approaches. Community-based targeting can prevent elites from capturing social transfers, drawing on local knowledge to identify people most eligible for social protection. African farmers have found vocal allies in autonomous civil society organizations, which can mobilize public interest around issues, monitor the performance of governments and lobby them to act in line with basic human rights. In addition to rights-based organizations, a range of development-based civil society organizations focused on charity, recovery and relief undertake food security interventions. But African civil society is still evolving, so its role in delivering food security can be neither discounted nor relied on completely. Accountability is the necessary counterpart to voice. When accountable authorities answer to engaged communities, social justice is served. In the short run community organization and civic engagement will have to fill many gaps. Communitybased social audits to monitor delivery of social protection programmes and other public services--- and rights-based (rather than discretionary) approaches that elevate interventions to the status of citizens' rights---can strengthen the social contract between people and their government. Control over land is crucial for smallholder farmers. In sub-Saharan Africa family holdings pass from one generation to the next with ill-defined rights of tenure, leaving smallholder farmers vulnerable to dispossession and exploitation. A new development that risks aggravating these insecurities is the recent international scramble for land in sub-Saharan Africa. One danger is that largescale investments may displace people without consultation or adequate compensation. In countries where many people work in agriculture, separating them from their land without first creating opportunities in nonfarm sectors is likely to increase poverty, unemployment and food insecurity. There are strong and mutually reinforcing links between expanding women's capabilities--- through better education, more direct control over resources and a more decisive voice in decision-making--- and enhancing food security. Empowering women, who make up almost half the agricultural labour force in sub-Saharan Africa, is a highly efficient way to achieve progress across the multiple dimensions of food security. But even beyond such instrumental qualities and possible gains in efficiency, women's empowerment must remain a central policy priority because equality and nondiscrimination are of intrinsic value. As human rights, women's rights deserve to be promoted for that reason alone. Yet women in sub-Saharan Africa have less control than men do over productive resources such as assets, land and credit; their time is often devoted to activities that are nonmarketed and undervalued; and their access to key institutions such as courts and markets is curtailed. Famines and food crises continue to plague the region as nowhere else. The cycles of hunger and despair with which so many Africans struggle and ``cope,'' and which too often trap them, show no signs of letting go. Responsibility for these appalling conditions is shared among governments, institutions and markets in the region and abroad. The challenge of food security in sub-Saharan Africa is formidable, the timeframe for action is tight and the investment required is substantial. But the potential gains for human development are immense.},

  abstract = {BackgroundSoil ecosystems harbor the most complex prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities on Earth. Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of {$\sim$}98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO2 fixation.Conclusions/SignificanceThis approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods.},

Phylogenetic analyses of a four-gene dataset (atp6, tef1, rpb2 and cox3) with a wide selection of Boletaceae showed that the new genus is monophyletic and sister to the genera Cupreoboletus and Cyanoboletus in the Pulveroboletus group. Two new species in the genus, C.pallidicarneus and C.tenebrosus are described from northern Thailand. Full descriptions and illustrations of the new genus and species are presented. The phylogeny also confirmed the reciprocal monophyly of Neoboletus and Sutorius, which further support the separation of these two genera.},

Typical characters of Erythrophylloporus are reddish-orange to yellowish-red basidiomata, including lamellae, bright yellow basal mycelium and smooth, broadly ellipsoid, ellipsoid to nearly ovoid basidiospores. During our survey on diversity of Boletaceae in Thailand, several yellowish-orange to reddish- or brownish-orange lamellate boletes were collected. Based on both morphological evidence and molecular analyses of a four-gene dataset (atp6, tef1, rpb2 and cox3), they were recognised as belonging in Erythrophylloporus and different from the already known species. Two new species, E.paucicarpus and E.suthepensis are therefore introduced from Thailand with detailed descriptions and illustrations. Moreover, two previously described Phylloporus species, P.aurantiacus and P.fagicola, were also revised and recombined in Erythrophylloporus. A key to all known Erythrophylloporus species is provided.},

Combined evidence from morphology and phylogenetic analyses of a three-gene data set (atp6, tef1 and rpb2) of the Sutorius collections along with selected Boletaceae in the Pulveroboletus group indicated that Thai collections represent seven new Sutorius species. The analyses also indicated that Tylopilus maculatoides belongs in Sutorius. Therefore, the transfer of T. maculatoides to Sutorius is proposed. Full descriptions, illustrations of the seven new species and S. maculatoides are presented in this study. With the seven new species and the new combination, eight of the eleven described Sutorius species are known to occur in Northern and Northeastern Thailand, while only one species are known from each of two continents, the Americas and Australia.},

  abstract = {Almost all land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi. These below-ground fungi play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems as they regulate nutrient and carbon cycles, and influence soil structure and ecosystem multifunctionality. Up to 80\% of plant N and P is provided by mycorrhizal fungi and many plant species depend on these symbionts for growth and survival. Estimates suggest that there are c. 50 000 fungal species that form mycorrhizal associations with c. 250 000 plant species. The development of high-throughput molecular tools has helped us to better understand the biology, evolution, and biodiversity of mycorrhizal associations. Nuclear genome assemblies and gene annotations of 33 mycorrhizal fungal species are now available providing fascinating opportunities to deepen our understanding of the mycorrhizal lifestyle, the metabolic capabilities of these plant symbionts, the molecular dialogue between symbionts, and evolutionary adaptations across a range of mycorrhizal associations. Large-scale molecular surveys have provided novel insights into the diversity, spatial and temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. At the ecological level, network theory makes it possible to analyze interactions between plant--fungal partners as complex underground multi-species networks. Our analysis suggests that nestedness, modularity and specificity of mycorrhizal networks vary and depend on mycorrhizal type. Mechanistic models explaining partner choice, resource exchange, and coevolution in mycorrhizal associations have been developed and are being tested.

  abstract = {abstract To respond to the changing environment, cells must be able to sense external conditions. This is important for many processes including growth, mating, the expression of virulence factors, and several other regulatory effects. Nutrient sensing at the plasma membrane is mediated by different classes of membrane proteins that activate downstream signaling pathways: nontransporting receptors, transceptors, classical and nonclassical G-protein-coupled receptors, and the newly defined extracellular mucin receptors. Nontransporting receptors have the same structure as transport proteins, but have lost the capacity to transport while gaining a receptor function. Transceptors are transporters that also function as a receptor, because they can rapidly activate downstream signaling pathways. In this review, we focus on these four types of fungal membrane proteins. We mainly discuss the sensing mechanisms relating to sugars, ammonium, and amino acids. Mechanisms for other nutrients, such as phosphate and sulfate, are discussed briefly. Because the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the most studied, especially regarding these nutrient-sensing systems, each subsection will commence with what is known in this species.},

  abstract = {A discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the Markov Cluster Process or the MCL process. The process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix, where  k{$\in\backslash$}N k{$\in\backslash$}N . Inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator  {$\Gamma$} r {$\Gamma$}r ,  r{$\geq$}0 r{$\geq$}0 , that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image  {$\Gamma$} r M {$\Gamma$}rM  is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inflation operator  {$\Gamma$} r {$\Gamma$}r  maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. For  r{$\in\backslash$}N r{$\in\backslash$}N  and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image  {$\Gamma$} r M {$\Gamma$}rM  is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of  {$\Gamma$} {$\infty$} M {$\Gamma\infty$}M  is of the form  \{ 0 n-k , 1 k \} \{0n-k,1k\} , where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M, and n is the dimension of M. This attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.},

In particular, our understanding of the daunting diversity of soil microbes has grown to maturity, opening up a new box of challenging research questions about microbial functioning and interactions. We here review recent developments in, as well as the state-of-the-art of, the molecular methods applied to soil, and discuss a few salient cases in which they have enhanced our understanding of the soil microbiota and its functioning. In particular, we place a focus on the interface between soil fungal hyphae and the corresponding non-fungal-affected soil, i.e., the mycosphere. This selective environment may reduce the diversity of its inhabitants, allowing an improved picture of their ecology and functioning via molecular techniques. We present arguments for the contention that, to investigate testable hypotheses, a polyphasic approach is needed, in which work on the basis of molecular approaches such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics is coupled to that based on culturable organisms. Thus, advances in our understanding of local functioning and adaptation of bacterial mycosphere inhabitants will be fostered by combined metagenomics/metatranscriptomics and cultivation-based approaches.},

  title = {{Examining the macro-evolution and genetic background of complex multicellular structures in mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes)}},
  author = {Varga, Torda},
  year = {2020},
  month = oct,
  urldate = {2021-02-11},
  abstract = {Several major transitions have happened through the evolution of life, such as the evolution of eukaryotes, plastids, or multicellularity. Multicellular organisms exist in all biogeographic realms and are essential components of most present ecosystems. Simple multicellular organisms form aggregates or colonies of cells and have arisen in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages at least 25 times. In contrast, complex multicellularity, where three-dimensional structures are developed and only some of their cells are in direct contact with the environment, evolved exclusively in five eukaryotic lineages from which three dominate the present terrestrial ecosystems: animals, embryophytic land plants and fungi. Despite the prevalence of complex multicellularity on Earth, the driving force and the genetic background of the evolution of complex multicellular organisms are incompletely known. Both biotic and abiotic factors could drive the evolution of complex multicellularity such as changes in feeding mode, increase in atmospheric oxygen, or whole-genome duplications. Pieces of evidence also mount that the evolution of multicellular organisms was driven by exaptation, a mechanism where a pre-existing genetic toolkit of ancestors can give new adaptive features for descendants. The fungal kingdom is one of the five main groups where complex multicellularity evolved, but complex multicellularity could have convergently appeared at least eight times within fungi. The convergent evolution of complex multicellularity in the fungal kingdom implies a unique evolutionary solution for developing complex structures. Fungal complex multicellular structures are bound to a particular life period (fruiting bodies) or circumstances (mycorrhizae, rhizomorphs), and these are only a part of the whole organism. In contrast to this, the whole individual is the complex multicellular entity in other complex multicellular organisms. Possibly, the most common fungal complex multicellular structures are the sexual fruiting bodies, whose primary purpose is to produce meiotic spores in a protective environment and facilitate spore dispersal. Agaricomycetes, also called mushroom-forming fungi, contain more than 20,000 species, which produce fruiting bodies. Therefore, examining this class of fungi with phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) would widen our knowledge on the macro-evolution of complex morphologies in fungi. Previous studies have examined small datasets or separate Agaricomycetes taxa using PCMs.  So far, it is revealed that the evolution of mushrooms could have started as a resupinate ancestor (crust-like fruiting body) and through a coralloid/clavarioid type, pileate-stipitate mushrooms (fruiting body with cap and stipe) convergently evolved. It was also showed that pileate-stipitate fruiting bodies could increase the diversification rate of lineages, indicating that this morphology bears advantageous traits for species. However, the global evolutionary history of the Agaricomycetes and some of the key traits of pileate-stipitate mushrooms (presence of cap, protecting veils, structured hymenophore) have not been examined using sufficiently large and robust data. Therefore, we gathered specimens of Agaricomycetes from every geographical region except Antarctica and assembled a dataset containing 5,284 species and three genomic loci (nrLSU, rpb2, tef1-{$\alpha$}). Using this dataset, we performed maximum likelihood (ML) inference, and we constrained the topology of the backbone based on a phylogenomic tree consist of 105 species. Overall, 245 ML trees were inferred, covering the topological variety of Agaricomycetes phylogeny based on Robinson-Foulds pairwise distances. We also performed molecular clock calibration on ten trees selected by stratified random sampling to represent the topology diversity of the 245 trees. The molecular clock calibration was done by a two-step time calibration strategy. This procedure was based on using a robust and precise method on the ten percent of the species to infer parameters. Then, the time calibration of trees with all species was performed using a less precise but a fast algorithm to which the parameters inferred in the first step was inputted. Most of the order-level clades were dated to the Jurassic period (200-145 Ma ago), including the two subclasses Agaricomycetidae and Phallomycetidae. These ages are older than the time estimates of previous studies, therefore we tried to disentangle the underlying causes by reconstructing time-calibrated phylogenomic trees with various settings to perform a sensitivity analysis. Overall, we found that the precise placement of fossil calibration point on the phylogeny has the most significant effect on age estimates, and the number of fossil calibration points, the type of the tree (phylogenetic vs. phylogenomic) and the software choice have a smaller effect on the result of the time calibration. Therefore, we think our analyses provide a robust and sta},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as symbionts of many tree species in temperate forests, are thought to play an important role in forest regeneration processes after large disturbances. Their reaction to different disturbance and management regimes was studied in spruce forests (Lariceto-Piceetum) 10 years after a severe windthrow in the Tatra National Park (Slovak Republic). ECM community structure was compared between different ``management types{${''}$}---cleared area (EXT), area affected by wildfire (FIRE), uncleared area left for natural development (NEX), and mature forest as a control (REF). Based on Illumina sequencing of soil samples, we determined that the percentage of sequences assigned to ECM fungi decreased with increasing disturbance and management intensity (REF {$\rightarrow$} NEX {$\rightarrow$} EXT {$\rightarrow$} FIRE). Similarly, the total number of ECM species per each of ten sampling points per plot (100 ha) differed between managed (EXT-11 species, FIRE-9) and unmanaged (NEX-16, REF-14) treatments. On the other hand, the percentage of sequences belonging to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi increased. Management type significantly influenced the composition of the ECM community, while vegetation and soil characteristics explained less data variation. The ECM species assemblage of the unmanaged site (NEX) was the most similar to the mature forest, while that of the burnt site was the most different. Thelephora terrestris dominated in all treatments affected by windthrow, accompanied by Tylospora fibrillosa (NEX) and Tylospora asterophora (EXT and FIRE). Management regime was also the most important factor affecting ECM species composition on the roots of spruce seedlings assessed by Sanger sequencing.},

  abstract = {Genome sequencing is an important step toward correlating genotypes with phenotypic characters. Sequencing technologies are important in many fields in the life sciences, including functional genomics, transcriptomics, oncology, evolutionary biology, forensic sciences, and many more. The era of sequencing has been divided into three generations. First generation sequencing involved sequencing by synthesis (Sanger sequencing) and sequencing by cleavage (Maxam-Gilbert sequencing). Sanger sequencing led to the completion of various genome sequences (including human) and provided the foundation for development of other sequencing technologies. Since then, various techniques have been developed which can overcome some of the limitations of Sanger sequencing. These techniques are collectively known as ``Next-generation sequencing'' (NGS), and are further classified into second and third generation technologies. Although NGS methods have many advantages in terms of speed, cost, and parallelism, the accuracy and read length of Sanger sequencing is still superior and has confined the use of NGS mainly to resequencing genomes. Consequently, there is a continuing need to develop improved real time sequencing techniques. This chapter reviews some of the options currently available and provides a generic workflow for sequencing a genome.},

  abstract = {Optimal foraging theory predicts that predators are selective when faced with abundant prey, but become less picky when prey gets sparse. Insectivorous bats in temperate regions are faced with the challenge of building up fat reserves vital for hibernation during a period of decreasing arthropod abundances. According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour -- yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a significant increase in the availability of black flies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.},

The most common molecular strategies for estimating taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA.},

  abstract = {Although the commonly used internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA (ITS) is well suited for taxonomic identification of fungi, the information on the relative abundance of taxa and diversity is negatively affected by the multicopy nature of rDNA and the existence of ITS paralogues. Moreover, due to high variability, ITS sequences cannot be used for phylogenetic analyses of unrelated taxa. The part of single-copy gene encoding the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) was thus compared with first spacer of ITS as an alternative marker for the analysis of fungal communities in spruce forest topsoil, and their applicability was tested on a comprehensive mock community. In soil, rpb2 exhibited broad taxonomic coverage of the entire fungal tree of life including basal fungal lineages. The gene exhibited sufficient variation for the use in phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic assignments, although it amplifies also paralogues. The fungal taxon spectra obtained with rbp2 region and ITS1 corresponded, but sequence abundance differed widely, especially in the basal lineages. The proportions of OTU counts and read counts of major fungal groups were close to the reality when rpb2 was used as a molecular marker while they were strongly biased towards the Basidiomycota when using the ITS primers ITS1/ITS4. Although the taxonomic placement of rbp2 sequences is currently more difficult than that of the ITS sequences, its discriminative power, quantitative representation of community composition and suitability for phylogenetic analyses represent significant advantages.},

  abstract = {Detailed restriction analyses of many samples often require substantial amounts of time and effort for DNA extraction, restriction digests, Southern blotting, and hybridization. We describe a novel approach that uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for rapid simplified restriction typing and mapping of DNA from many different isolates. DNA fragments up to 2 kilobase pairs in length were efficiently amplified from crude DNA samples of several pathogenic Cryptococcus species, including C. neoformans, C. albidus, C. laurentii, and C. uniguttulatus. Digestion and electrophoresis of the PCR products by using frequent-cutting restriction enzymes produced complex restriction phenotypes (fingerprints) that were often unique for each strain or species. We used the PCR to amplify and analyze restriction pattern variation within three major portions of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats from these fungi. Detailed mapping of many restriction sites within the rDNA locus was determined by fingerprint analysis of progressively larger PCR fragments sharing a common primer site at one end. As judged by PCR fingerprints, the rDNA of 19 C. neoformans isolates showed no variation for four restriction enzymes that we surveyed. Other Cryptococcus spp. showed varying levels of restriction pattern variation within their rDNAs and were shown to be genetically distinct from C. neoformans. The PCR primers used in this study have also been successfully applied for amplification of rDNAs from other pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi, including Candida spp., and ought to have wide applicability for clinical detection and other studies.},

  abstract = {Total macro fungus frequency in closed forest associations of the Laurentide Mountains varied little (147 -- 185 \%) from one to another. The macrofungal flora of the deciduous forest was composed mainly of many infrequent species, whereas coniferous forests had few, but very frequent, macrofungi. Total frequency was significantly lower (15\%) in open stands of the spruce--cladina association. Species richness decreased gradually (from 125 to 34 species) towards the north and with increasing altitude. Both the Simpson and the Shannon--Wiener diversity indices were significantly lower in the coniferous forest when compared with the deciduous forest. This decrease in diversity was due to the scarcity of saprophytic fungi in mor humus, whereas the number of ectomycorrhizal species remained constant. The diversity of saprophytic fungi was related significantly to that of vascular plants, whereas the diversity of ectomycorrhizal macrofungi was related mainly to the percent cover of ectomycorrhizal hosts. A total of 195 species of macrofungi were recorded for the study sites. In the maple -- yellow birch forest, most of the macrofungi were saprophytic members of the Tricholomataceae, Hygrophoraceae, Strophariaceae, and Clavariaceae, many being exclusive in this association. However, each biological group had approximately equal frequency (44--54\%) and richness (37--45 taxa). Species composition of the coniferous forest differed from the former in the clear dominance of ectomycorrhizal macrofungi from the Cortinariaceae, Russulaceae, and the Boletaceae. In the black spruce -- cladina association, saprophytic fungi were scarce and ectomycorrhizal species were also relatively infrequent. In all the sites, the equitability of macrofungal frequency was high, as seen by the high proportion of rare species. The decline in species richness observed in this study, when moving from deciduous to coniferous forests, corresponds well with the increase in environmental rigor and instability, as well as the decrease in the diversity of organic substrate and species of vascular plants.}

(2012). Here, we combine a further study of the genetic structure of L. amethystina populations from Europe to southwestern China and Japan, using neutral Single Sequence Repeat (SSR; microsatellite) markers; and a systematic description of two novel Asian species, namely Laccaria moshuijun and Laccaria japonica, based on ecological, morphological, and molecular criteria (rDNA sequences). Population genetics provides evidence of the ancient isolation of three regional groups, with strong signal for speciation, and suggests a centre of origin of modern populations closest to present-day Chinese populations. Phylogenetic analyses confirm speciation at the molecular level, reflected in morphological features: L. moshuijun samples (from Yunnan, China) display strongly variable cheilocystidia, while L. japonica samples (from Japan) present distinctive globose to subglobose spores and clavate cheilocystidia. This study of a species complex primarily described with an extremely wide ecological and geographical range sheds new light on the biodiversity and biogeography of ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

  abstract = {Penicillium is a diverse genus occurring worldwide and its species play important roles as decomposers of organic materials and cause destructive rots in the food industry where they produce a wide range of mycotoxins. Other species are considered enzyme factories or are common indoor air allergens. Although DNA sequences are essential for robust identification of Penicillium species, there is currently no comprehensive, verified reference database for the genus. To coincide with the move to one fungus one name in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants, the generic concept of Penicillium was re-defined to accommodate species from other genera, such as Chromocleista, Eladia, Eupenicillium, Torulomyces and Thysanophora, which together comprise a large monophyletic clade. As a result of this, and the many new species described in recent years, it was necessary to update the list of accepted species in Penicillium. The genus currently contains 354 accepted species, including new combinations for Aspergillus crystallinus, A.~malodoratus and A.~paradoxus, which belong to Penicillium section Paradoxa. To add to the taxonomic value of the list, we also provide information on each accepted species MycoBank number, living ex-type strains and provide GenBank accession numbers to ITS, {$\beta$}-tubulin, calmodulin and RPB2 sequences, thereby supplying a verified set of sequences for each species of the genus. In addition to the nomenclatural list, we recommend a standard working method for species descriptions and identifications to be adopted by laboratories working on this genus.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration causes the second largest C flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Emerging soil carbon dynamics models consider the complex interplay of microscale interactions between the physical and biological drivers of soil organic matter decomposition occurring in the 3D soil architecture. They are expected to provide a way to upscale results to the macroscopic level and as such appear as an alternative modelling approach to the traditional ``black-box'' macroscopic models. However, these models still need to be tested under a broader range of their parameters values and structures than has been the case to date. We thus conducted uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of previous predictions on dissolved organic carbon biodegradation obtained by one of these microscopic carbon dynamics models, LBioS. Six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of LBioS, associated with bacterial metabolism and three microscopic 3D descriptors of soil architecture were considered as uncertain inputs. We built two complete factorial designs in which the minimum and maximum of uncertainty intervals are considered. Each factorial design is assigned to a particular structure of the model, one including dormancy of bacteria and the other considering optimal bacterial activity. The scenarios took place in 3D computed tomography images of an undisturbed cultivated soil. The sensitivity indices at different simulations dates were computed with an ANOVA procedure taking into account main effects and interactions among factors. The uncertainty analysis shows that only in the limiting case of low accessibility of resources to bacteria the different microbial metabolisms tested can modify to a small extent the system responses, and uncertainty linked to parameters describing soil architecture becomes preponderant. In the case of optimal accessibility output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the microbial metabolism parameters. The sensitivity analysis suggests that whatever the structure of the model, the role of soil architecture in the microbial activity can be evidenced using either DOC or CO2 as proxy measures. Beyond these results, we stress that results of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of soil carbon models need to be interpreted with caution, dependent as they are on the status of the model itself, as well as on the particular scenarios used in the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.},

  abstract = {Root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can be quantified by different approaches. We compared two approaches that enable discrimination of specific AMF taxa and are therefore emerging as alternative to most commonly performed microscopic quantification of AMF in roots: quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using markers in nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) and mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (mtDNA). In a greenhouse experiment, Medicago truncatula was inoculated with four isolates belonging to different AMF species (Rhizophagus irregularis, Claroideoglomus claroideum, Gigaspora margarita and Funneliformis mosseae). The AMF were quantified in the root samples by qPCR targeted to both markers, microscopy and contents of AMF-specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Copy numbers of nrDNA and mtDNA were closely related within all isolates; however, the slopes and intercepts of the linear relationships significantly differed among the isolates. Across all isolates, a large proportion of variance in nrDNA copy numbers was explained by root colonization intensity or contents of AMF-specific PLFA, while variance in mtDNA copy numbers was mainly explained by differences among AMF isolates. We propose that the encountered inter-isolate differences in the ratios of mtDNA and nrDNA copy numbers reflect different physiological states of the isolates. Our results suggest that nrDNA is a more suitable marker region than mtDNA for the quantification of multiple AMF taxa as its copy numbers are better related to fungal biomass across taxa than are copy numbers of mtDNA.},

  abstract = {Although mutualistic symbioses per definition are beneficial for interacting species, conflict may arise if partners reproduce independently. We address how this reproductive conflict is regulated in the obligate mutualistic symbiosis between fungus-growing termites and Termitomyces fungi. Even though the termites and their fungal symbiont disperse independently to establish new colonies, dispersal is correlated in time. The fungal symbiont typically forms mushrooms a few weeks after the colony has produced dispersing alates. It is thought that this timing is due to a trade-off between alate and worker production; alate production reduces resources available for worker production. As workers consume the fungus, reduced numbers of workers will allow mushrooms to `escape' from the host colony. Here, we test a specific version of this hypothesis: the typical asexual structures found in all species of Termitomyces---nodules---are immature stages of mushrooms that are normally harvested by the termites at a primordial stage. We refute this hypothesis by showing that nodules and mushroom primordia are macro- and microscopically different structures and by showing that in the absence of workers, primordia do, and nodules do not grow out into mushrooms. It remains to be tested whether termite control of primordia formation or of primordia outgrowth mitigates the reproductive conflict.},

Sequences of two loci, ITS and LSU, were generated as barcode data for all (ca. 9k) yeast strains included in the CBS collection, originally assigned to ca. 2\hphantom{,}000 species. Taxonomic sequence validation turned out to be the most severe bottleneck due to the large volume of generated trace files and lack of reference sequences. We have analysed and validated CBS strains and barcode sequences automatically. Our analysis shows that there were 6 and 9.5~\% of CBS yeast species that could not be distinguished by ITS and LSU, respectively. Among them, {$\sim$}3~\% were indistinguishable by both loci. Except for those species, both loci were successfully resolving yeast species as the grouping of yeast DNA barcodes with the predicted taxonomic thresholds was more than 90~\% similar to the grouping with respect to the expected taxon names. The taxonomic thresholds predicted to discriminate yeast species were 98.41~\% for ITS and 99.51~\% for LSU. To discriminate current yeast genera, thresholds were 96.31~\% for ITS and 97.11~\% for LSU. Using ITS and LSU barcodes, we were also able to show that the recent reclassifications of basidiomycetous yeasts in 2015 have made a significant improvement for the generic taxonomy of those organisms. The barcodes of 4\hphantom{,}730 (51~\%) CBS yeast strains of 1\hphantom{,}351 (80~\%) accepted yeast species that were manually validated have been released to GenBank and the CBS-KNAW website as reference sequences for yeast identification.},

  abstract = {Species identification lies at the heart of biodiversity studies that has in recent years favoured DNA-based approaches. Microbial Biological Resource Centres are a rich source for diverse and high-quality reference materials in microbiology, and yet the strains preserved in these biobanks have been exploited only on a limited scale to generate DNA barcodes. As part of a project funded in the Netherlands to barcode specimens of major national biobanks, sequences of two nuclear ribosomal genetic markers, the Internal Transcribed Spaces and 5.8S gene (ITS) and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S Large Subunit (LSU), were generated as DNA barcode data for ca. 100\hphantom{,}000 fungal strains originally assigned to ca. 17\hphantom{,}000 species in the CBS fungal biobank maintained at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht. Using more than 24\hphantom{,}000 DNA barcode sequences of 12\hphantom{,}000 ex-type and manually validated filamentous fungal strains of 7\hphantom{,}300 accepted species, the optimal identity thresholds to discriminate filamentous fungal species were predicted as 99.6~\% for ITS and 99.8~\% for LSU. We showed that 17~\% and 18~\% of the species could not be discriminated by the ITS and LSU genetic markers, respectively. Among them, {$\sim$}8~\% were indistinguishable using both genetic markers. ITS has been shown to outperform LSU in filamentous fungal species discrimination with a probability of correct identification of 82~\% vs. 77.6~\%, and a clustering quality value of 84~\% vs. 77.7~\%. At higher taxonomic classifications, LSU has been shown to have a better discriminatory power than ITS. With a clustering quality value of 80~\%, LSU outperformed ITS in identifying filamentous fungi at the ordinal level. At the generic level, the clustering quality values produced by both genetic markers were low, indicating the necessity for taxonomic revisions at genus level and, likely, for applying more conserved genetic markers or even whole genomes. The taxonomic thresholds predicted for filamentous fungal identification at the genus, family, order and class levels were 94.3~\%, 88.5~\%, 81.2~\% and 80.9~\% based on ITS barcodes, and 98.2~\%, 96.2~\%, 94.7~\% and 92.7~\% based on LSU barcodes. The DNA barcodes used in this study have been deposited to GenBank and will also be publicly available at the Westerdijk Institute's website as reference sequences for fungal identification, marking an unprecedented data release event in global fungal barcoding efforts to date.},

  abstract = {Sequence classification plays an important role in metagenomics studies. We assess the deep neural network approach for fungal sequence classification as it has emerged as a successful paradigm for big data classification and clustering. Two deep learning-based classifiers, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deep belief network (DBN) were trained using our recently released barcode datasets. Experimental results show that CNN outperformed the traditional BLAST classification and the most accurate machine learning based Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier on datasets that had many of the labels present in the training datasets. When classifying an independent dataset namely the ``Top 50 Most Wanted Fungi'', CNN and DBN assigned less sequences than BLAST. However, they could assign much more sequences than the RDP classifier. In terms of efficiency, it took the machine learning classifiers up to two seconds to classify a test dataset while it was 53~s for BLAST. The result of the current study will enable us to speed up the taxonomic assignments for the fungal barcode sequences generated at our institute as {\textasciitilde}\,70\% of them still need to be validated for public release. In addition, it will help to quickly provide a taxonomic profile for metagenomics samples.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a group of soil and root inhabiting fungi that represent an ancient plant-fungi symbiosis. These fungi interconnect multiple plant individuals and species simultaneously generating a complex fungal network belowground that plays a significant role in shaping plant community composition and ecosystem productivity. However, the underlying mechanisms as to how AM fungal networks and their diversity influence plant performance and community structure are not always predictable and are frequently debated. Although all potential plant hosts may be able to associate with all AM fungi, plant-AM fungal associations can result in a range of AM fungal facilitative and antagonistic effects on plants. Although the facilitative effects of AM fungi have long been studied, the extent and mechanisms of AM fungal antagonistic effects are much less understood. Moreover, AM fungi are observed to vary in their functional properties and temporal patterns adding further complexity to the potential mechanisms by which AM fungi and the diversity of AM fungi determine plant community composition and productivity through their facilitative and antagonistic effects on plants. Here we review the potential mechanisms by which AM fungal communities facilitate greater diversity and productivity in plant communities, as well as the potential mechanisms by which AM fungi may be antagonistic to plant performance. Specifically we address how AM fungal communities might facilitate greater plant community performance through functional complementarity among AM fungi as a result of functional, spatial and temporal niche segregation. We also address facilitative and antagonistic aspects of AM fungi through their ability to allocate resources among plant community members that consequently facilitates plant recruitment and alters plant-plant competitive outcomes. By considering the multiple facets by which AM fungi may be facilitative or antagonistic to plants we identify potential knowledge gaps in mechanistically predicting how AM fungal communities shape plant community composition and maintain ecosystem productivity.},

This carbon is used for building extensive mycelial networks in the soil as well as for metabolic activity related to nutrient uptake. Here we discuss the factors that regulate the production and turnover of EMM and its role in soil C dynamics and nitrogen retention. C availability seems to be the key factor determining EMM production and possibly its standing biomass in forests but direct effects of mineral nutrient availability on the EMM can also be important. There is great uncertainty about the rate of turnover of EMM, and the increasing evidence that residues of EM fungi play a major role in the formation of stable N and C in soil organic matter highlights the need to include mycorrhizal effects in models of global soil C stores.},

The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},

  abstract = {{$\bullet$} The colonization of land by plants fundamentally altered environmental conditions on earth. Plant--mycorrhizal fungus symbiosis likely played a key role in this process by assisting plants to absorb water and nutrients from soil. {$\bullet$} Here, in a diverse set of land plants, we investigated the evolutionary histories and functional conservation of three genes required for mycorrhiza formation in legumes and rice (Oryza sativa), DMI1, DMI3 and IPD3. {$\bullet$} The genes were isolated from nearly all major plant lineages. Phylogenetic analyses showed that they had been vertically inherited since the origin of land plants. Further, cross-species mutant rescue experiments demonstrated that DMI3 genes from liverworts and hornworts could rescue Medicago truncatula dmi3 mutants for mycorrhiza formation. Yeast two-hybrid assays also showed that bryophyte DMI3 proteins could bind to downstream-acting M. trunculata IPD3 protein. Finally, molecular evolutionary analyses revealed that these genes were under purifying selection for maintenance of their ancestral functions in all mycorrhizal plant lineages. {$\bullet$} These results indicate that the mycorrhizal genes were present in the common ancestor of land plants, and that their functions were largely conserved during land plant evolution. The evidence presented here strongly suggests that plant--mycorrhizal fungus symbiosis was one of the key processes that contributed to the origin of land flora.},

The development and optimization of mycorrhization methods have led to the successful laboratory or field cultivation of several species in these genera. Modern microscopy combined with molecular techniques has allowed effective monitoring of specific fungal isolates introduced to non-sterile field environments. Molecular tools also continue to clarify phylogenetic relationships between species and provide solutions to commercial issues, including traceability and quality assurance. Gourmet species such as the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus) and shoro (Rhizopogon roseolus) can now be cultivated reliably in Pinus plantations, and, in New Zealand, we can foresee the commercial cultivation of these fungi in the next few years. Matsutake (Tricholoma matsutake), one of the most sought-after gourmet species, still defies cultivation attempts. This is in spite of considerable research and recent progress in understanding mycorrhiza and shiro formation, host interactions, and fundamental biology (including sexual reproduction, saprophytic capability, and relationships with other microorganisms). The management of natural populations of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and the further development and improvement of cultivation techniques are critical to ensure the preservation of the long-term benefits offered by these fungi. Continued research is essential to promote further cultivation successes and to reverse the dramatic decline of natural populations of economically important species currently threatened by environmental disturbance and non-sustainable commercial harvesting.},

Here, we predicted 18S rRNA primers based on consecutive conserved sites and evaluated their coverage efficiency and scope of application to different eukaryotic groups. After evaluation, eight of them were considered as qualified 18S primers based on coverage rate. Next, we examined common conserved regions in prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences to design 16S/18S universal primers. Three 16S/18S candidate primers, U515, U1390 and U1492, were then considered to be suitable for simultaneous amplification of the rRNA sequences in three domains. Eukaryotic 18S and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes in a sponge were amplified simultaneously using universal primers U515 and U1390, and the subsequent sorting of pyrosequenced reads revealed some distinctive communities in different parts of the sample. The real difference in biodiversity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts could be discerned as the dissimilarity between OTUs was increased from 0.005 to 0.1. A network of the communities in external and internal parts of the sponge illustrated the co-variation of some unique microbes in certain parts of the sponge, suggesting that the universal primers are useful in simultaneous detection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities.},

  abstract = {Fungi play essential roles in many ecological processes, and taxonomic classification is fundamental for microbial community characterization and vital for the study and preservation of fungal biodiversity. To cope with massive fungal barcode data, tools that can implement extensive volumes of barcode sequences, especially the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, are necessary. However, high variation in the ITS region and computational requirements for processing high-dimensional features remain challenging for existing predictors. In this study, we developed Its2vec, a bioinformatics tool for the classification of fungal ITS barcodes to the species level. An ITS database covering more than 25,000 species in a broad range of fungal taxa was assembled. For dimensionality reduction, a word embedding algorithm was used to represent an ITS sequence as a dense low-dimensional vector. A random forest-based classifier was built for species identification. Benchmarking results showed that our model achieved an accuracy comparable to that of several state-of-the-art predictors, and more importantly, it could implement large datasets and greatly reduce dimensionality. We expect the Its2vec model to be helpful for fungal species identification and, thus, for revealing microbial community structures and in deepening our understanding of their functional mechanisms.},

The traditional use of supertree methods is the assembly of a large species tree from previously computed smaller species trees; however, supertree methods are also used to address large-scale tree estimation using divide-and-conquer (i.e., a dataset is divided into overlapping subsets, trees are constructed on the subsets, and then combined using the supertree method). Because most supertree methods are heuristics for NP-hard optimization problems, the use of supertree estimation on large datasets is challenging, both in terms of scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we describe the current state of the art in supertree construction and the use of supertree methods in divide-and-conquer strategies. Finally, we identify directions where future research could lead to improved supertree methods.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

Researchers tend to use and report indices that quantify agreement between two partitions for all clusters simultaneously. Commonly used examples are the Rand index and the adjusted Rand index. Since these overall measures give a general notion of what is going on, their values are usually hard to interpret. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough understanding of the adjusted Rand index as well as many other partition comparison indices based on counting object pairs. It is shown that many overall indices based on the pair-counting approach can be decomposed into indices that reflect the degree of agreement on the level of individual clusters. The decompositions (1) show that the overall indices can be interpreted as summary statistics of the agreement on the cluster level, (2) specify how these overall indices are related to the indices for individual clusters, and (3) show that the overall indices are affected by cluster size imbalance: if cluster sizes are unbalanced these overall measures will primarily reflect the degree of agreement between the partitions on the large clusters, and will provide much less information on the agreement on smaller clusters. Furthermore, the value of Rand-like indices is determined to a large extent by the number of pairs of objects that are not joined in either of the partitions.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

  abstract = {When conserving native biodiversity, it is particularly important to consider invertebrates, a diverse and functionally important component of biodiversity. However, their inclusion in monitoring and conservation planning has lagged behind larger fauna because collecting, sorting and identifying invertebrates using conventional monitoring techniques is often expensive, time consuming and restricted by expertise in diagnostics. Emerging DNA metabarcoding techniques could potentially revolutionise monitoring of invertebrates by providing the ability to characterise entire communities from a single, easily collected environmental sample. We aimed to characterise the invertebrate fauna of an isolated, coastal forest fragment in New Zealand using the same level of financial investment for conventional invertebrate monitoring (pitfall and malaise traps) and a DNA metabarcoding approach applied to two alternative sample types (conventional invertebrate samples and soil samples). The bulk invertebrate and soil DNA metabarcoding methods were able to reproduce ecological patterns observed in the beetle community detected using conventional sampling. The soil DNA metabarcoding method detected a different beetle community and a more diverse array of invertebrate taxa than conventional sampling techniques. DNA metabarcoding offers conservation managers a practical, cost-effective technique for characterising whole invertebrate communities. However, increasing the taxonomic coverage of reference sequence databases (particularly for New Zealand invertebrates) through DNA barcoding efforts should be the focus of future research as it would improve the utility of metabarcoding methods for invertebrate monitoring, which would complement conventional techniques.},

I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees ({$\geq$}10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ergosterol has been considered the "fungal sterol" for almost 125 years; however, additional sterol data superimposed on a recent molecular phylogeny of kingdom Fungi reveals a different and more complex situation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The interpretation of sterol distribution data in a modern phylogenetic context indicates that there is a clear trend from cholesterol and other Delta(5) sterols in the earliest diverging fungal species to ergosterol in later diverging fungi. There are, however, deviations from this pattern in certain clades. Sterols of the diverse zoosporic and zygosporic forms exhibit structural diversity with cholesterol and 24-ethyl -Delta(5) sterols in zoosporic taxa, and 24-methyl sterols in zygosporic fungi. For example, each of the three monophyletic lineages of zygosporic fungi has distinctive major sterols, ergosterol in Mucorales, 22-dihydroergosterol in Dimargaritales, Harpellales, and Kickxellales (DHK clade), and 24-methyl cholesterol in Entomophthorales. Other departures from ergosterol as the dominant sterol include: 24-ethyl cholesterol in Glomeromycota, 24-ethyl cholest-7-enol and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,24(28)-dienol in rust fungi, brassicasterol in Taphrinales and hypogeous pezizalean species, and cholesterol in Pneumocystis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Five dominant end products of sterol biosynthesis (cholesterol, ergosterol, 24-methyl cholesterol, 24-ethyl cholesterol, brassicasterol), and intermediates in the formation of 24-ethyl cholesterol, are major sterols in 175 species of Fungi. Although most fungi in the most speciose clades have ergosterol as a major sterol, sterols are more varied than currently understood, and their distribution supports certain clades of Fungi in current fungal phylogenies. In addition to the intellectual importance of understanding evolution of sterol synthesis in fungi, there is practical importance because certain antifungal drugs (e.g., azoles) target reactions in the synthesis of ergosterol. These findings also invalidate use of ergosterol as an indicator of biomass of certain fungal taxa (e.g., Glomeromycota).

The identification of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway was a seminal discovery in the quest to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern such processes. TOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase belonging to the family of phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases. Other members of this family include the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR,which are conserved from yeast to human, and DNA-PK and SMG1, which are not found in yeasts. TOR regulates growth (accumulation of mass), proliferation (accumulation in cell number), and survival in response to nutritional changes by diverse mechanisms that include regulation of anabolic and catabolic metabolism, nutrient uptake, protein translation and turnover, gene transcription, and the epigenome (reviewed in 1 -- 3).},

  abstract = {Within the basidiomycetes, the vast majority of known mycorrhizal species are homobasidiomycetes. It was therefore surprising when molecular and ultrastructural studies revealed a broad diversity of mycorrhizal associations involving members of the heterobasidiomycetous Sebacinaceae, fungi which, due to their inconspicuous basidiomes, have been often overlooked. To investigate the phylogenetic position of the Sebacinaceae within the basidiomycetes and to infer phylogenetic relationships within the Sebacinaceae, we made molecular phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear rDNA. We present a well-resolved phylogeny of the main lineages of basidiomycetes which suggests that the Sebacinaceae is the most basal group with known mycorrhizal members. Since more basal taxa of basidiomycetes consist of predominantly mycoparasitic and phytoparasitic fungi, it seems possible that a mycorrhizal life strategy, which was transformed into a saprotrophic strategy several times convergently, is an apomorphic character for the Hymenomycetidae. Mycorrhizal taxa of Sebacinaceae, including mycobionts of ectomycorrhizas, orchid mycorrhizas, ericoid mycorrhizas, and jungermannioid mycorrhizas, are distributed over two subgroups. One group contains species with macroscopically visible basidiomes, whereas members of the other group probably lack basidiomes. Sebacina appears to be polyphyletic; current species concepts in Sebacinaceae are questionable. Sebacina vermifera sensu Warcup \& Talbot consists of a broad complex of species possibly including mycobionts of jungermannioid and ericoid mycorrhizas.This wide spectrum of mycorrhizal types in one fungal family is unique. Extrapolating from the known rDNA sequences in Sebacinaceae, it is evident that there is a cosm of mycorrhizal biodiversity yet to be discovered in this group. Taxonomically, we recognise the Sebacinaceae as constituting a new order, the Sebacinales.},

  abstract = {Inconspicuous basidiomycetes from the order Sebacinales are known to be involved in a puzzling variety of mutualistic plant-fungal symbioses (mycorrhizae), which presumably involve transport of mineral nutrients. Recently a few members of this fungal order not fitting this definition and commonly referred to as `endophytes' have raised considerable interest by their ability to enhance plant growth and to increase resistance of their host plants against abiotic stress factors and fungal pathogens. Using DNA-based detection and electron microscopy, we show that Sebacinales are not only extremely versatile in their mycorrhizal associations, but are also almost universally present as symptomless endophytes. They occurred in field specimens of bryophytes, pteridophytes and all families of herbaceous angiosperms we investigated, including liverworts, wheat, maize, and the non-mycorrhizal model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They were present in all habitats we studied on four continents. We even detected these fungi in herbarium specimens originating from pioneering field trips to North Africa in the 1830s/40s. No geographical or host patterns were detected. Our data suggest that the multitude of mycorrhizal interactions in Sebacinales may have arisen from an ancestral endophytic habit by specialization. Considering their proven beneficial influence on plant growth and their ubiquity, endophytic Sebacinales may be a previously unrecognized universal hidden force in plant ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Root endophytism and mycorrhizal associations are complex derived traits in fungi that shape plant physiology. Sebacinales (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) display highly diverse interactions with plants. Although early-diverging Sebacinales lineages are root endophytes and/or have saprotrophic abilities, several more derived clades harbour obligate biotrophs forming mycorrhizal associations. Sebacinales thus display transitions from saprotrophy to endophytism and to mycorrhizal nutrition within one fungal order. This review discusses the genomic traits possibly associated with these transitions. We also show how molecular ecology revealed the hyperdiversity of Sebacinales and their evolutionary diversification into two sister families: Sebacinaceae encompasses mainly ectomycorrhizal and early-diverging saprotrophic species; the second family includes endophytes and lineages that repeatedly evolved ericoid, orchid and ectomycorrhizal abilities. We propose the name Serendipitaceae for this family and, within it, we transfer to the genus Serendipita the endophytic cultivable species Piriformospora indica and P. williamsii. Such cultivable Serendipitaceae species provide excellent models for root endophytism, especially because of available genomes, genetic tractability, and broad host plant range including important crop plants and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We review insights gained with endophytic Serendipitaceae species into the molecular mechanisms of endophytism and of beneficial effects on host plants, including enhanced resistance to abiotic and pathogen stress.},

  abstract = {Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5\% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications. IMPORTANCE The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms. An important step in this analysis is the assignment of sequences into taxonomic groups based on their similarity to sequences in a database or based on their similarity to each other, irrespective of a database. In this study, we present a new algorithm for the latter approach. The algorithm, OptiClust, seeks to optimize a metric of assignment quality by shuffling sequences between taxonomic groups. We found that OptiClust produces more robust assignments and does so in a rapid and memory-efficient manner. This advance will allow for a more robust analysis of microbial communities and the factors that shape them.},

  abstract = {Quaternary glaciations have played a major role in shaping the genetic diversity and distribution of plant species. Strong palaeoecological and genetic evidence supports a postglacial recolonization of most plant species to northern Europe from southern, eastern and even western glacial refugia. Although highly controversial, the existence of small in situ glacial refugia in northern Europe has recently gained molecular support. We used genomic analyses to examine the phylogeography of a species that is critical in this debate. Carex scirpoidea Michx subsp. scirpoidea is a dioecious, amphi-Atlantic arctic--alpine sedge that is widely distributed in North America, but absent from most of Eurasia, apart from three extremely disjunct populations in Norway, all well within the limits of the Weichselian ice sheet. Range-wide population sampling and variation at 5,307 single nucleotide polymorphisms show that the three Norwegian populations comprise unique evolutionary lineages divergent from Greenland with high between-population divergence. The Norwegian populations have low within-population genetic diversity consistent with having experienced genetic bottlenecks in glacial refugia, and host private alleles that probably accumulated in long-term isolated populations. Demographic analyses support a single, pre-Weichselian colonization into Norway from East Greenland, and subsequent divergence of the three populations in separate refugia. Other refugial areas are identified in North-east Greenland, Minnesota/Michigan, Colorado and Alaska. Admixed populations in British Columbia and West Greenland indicate postglacial contact. Taken together, evidence from this study strongly indicates in situ glacial survival in Scandinavia.},

  abstract = {Nutrient-rich water bodies are usually expected to host low species richness at the local scale (water body). Nevertheless, they can support a diverse and sometimes unique biodiversity when diversity is considered at a regional scale. This discrepancy between the two scales is well documented for natural water bodies, but little is known about biodiversity of artificial water bodies, like fish ponds. We hypothesise that nutrient-rich water bodies can collectively host high species richness at the regional scale. Thus, these are important ecosystems for the regional conservation of biodiversity. We investigated 84 fish ponds in the Dombes region, France, with five taxonomic groups: macrophytes, phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates, dragonflies, and amphibians. Species richness patterns were determined for {$\alpha$}- (single pond), {$\beta$}- (between ponds), and {$\gamma$}- (regional pond network) levels. For most studied species groups, richness per fish pond and at the regional level proved to be relatively high in comparison with natural ponds in other landscapes. Contribution of {$\alpha$}-diversity to regional diversity was highest for dragonflies with 41 \%, and lowest for amphibians and macrophytes with 16 and 18 \%, respectively. For macroinvertebrate families and phytoplankton genera it was intermediate. Contribution of {$\beta$}-diversity to regional diversity was similar for all species groups with 22--25 \%. Furthermore, some ponds hosted a large number of less frequent species and some endangered species, indicating that the conservation of biodiversity of fish ponds must be established at a regional scale.},

An important aspect of these studies is the inference of a phylogenetic tree, which explicitly describes evolutionary relationships between homologous sequences. This chapter provides an introduction to evolutionary trees and how to infer them from sequence data using some commonly used inferential methodology. It focuses on statistical methods for inferring trees and how to assess the confidence one should have in any resulting tree, with a particular emphasis on the underlying assumptions of the methods and how they might affect the tree estimate. There is also some discussion of the underlying algorithms used to perform tree search and recommendations regarding the performance of different algorithms. Finally, there are a few practical guidelines, including how to combine multiple software packages to improve inference, and a comparison between Bayesian and Maximum likelihood phylogenetics.},

  abstract = {Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This 'signal-space' approach allows for greater accuracy than existing 'base-space' tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8\%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5\% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3\%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3\%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.},

  abstract = {There is concern about the lack of recruitment of Acacia trees in the Negev desert of Israel. We have developed three models to estimate the frequency of recruitment necessary for long-term population survival (i.e. positive average population growth for 1,000 years and {$<$}10\% probability of extinction). Two models assume purely episodic recruitment based on the general notion that recruitment in arid environments is highly episodic. They differ in that the deterministic model investigates average dynamics while the stochastic model does not. Studies indicating that recruitment episodes in arid environments have been overemphasized motivated the development of the third model. This semi-stochastic model simulates a mixture of continuous and episodic recruitment. Model analysis was done analytically for the deterministic model and via running model simulations for the stochastic and semi-stochastic models. The deterministic and stochastic models predict that, on average, 2.2 and 3.7 recruitment events per century, respectively, are necessary to sustain the population. According to the semi-stochastic model, 1.6 large recruitment events per century and an annual probability of 50\% that a small recruitment event occurs are needed. A consequence of purely episodic recruitment is that all recruitment episodes produce extremely large numbers of recruits (i.e. at odds with field observations), an evaluation that holds even when considering that rare events must be large. Thus, the semi-stochastic model appears to be the most realistic model. Comparing the prediction of the semi-stochastic model to field observations in the Negev desert shows that the absence of observations of extremely large recruitment events is no reason for concern. However, the almost complete absence of small recruitment events is a serious reason for concern. The lack of recruitment may be due to decreased densities of large mammalian herbivores and might be further exacerbated by possible changes in climate, both in terms of average precipitation and the temporal distribution of rain.},

We describe a protocol through which we obtain orthologous markers for the crested newts (Amphibia: Salamandridae: Triturus), suitable for analysis of interspecific hybridization. We use transcriptome data of a single Triturus species and design 96 primer pairs that amplify c. 180 bp fragments positioned in 3-prime untranslated regions. Next, these markers are tested with uniplex PCR for a set of species spanning the taxonomical width of the genus Triturus. The 52 markers that consistently show a single band of expected length at gel electrophoreses for all tested crested newt species are then amplified in five multiplex PCRs (with a plexity of ten or eleven) for 132 individual newts: a set of 84 representing the seven (candidate) species and a set of 48 from a presumed hybrid population. After pooling multiplexes per individual, unique tags are ligated to link amplicons to individuals. Subsequently, individuals are pooled equimolar and sequenced on the Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing platform. A bioinformatics pipeline identifies the alleles and recodes these to a genotypic format. Next, we test the utility of our markers. baps allocates the 84 crested newt individuals representing (candidate) species to their expected (candidate) species, confirming the markers are suitable for species delineation. newhybrids, a hybrid index and hiest confirm the 48 individuals from the presumed hybrid population to be genetically admixed, illustrating the potential of the markers to identify interspecific hybridization.

  abstract = {This article provides an outline of the classification of the kingdom Fungi (including fossil fungi. i.e. dispersed spores, mycelia, sporophores, mycorrhizas). We treat 19 phyla of fungi. These are Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Caulochytriomycota, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Glomeromycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota and Zoopagomycota. The placement of all fungal genera is provided at the class-, order- and family-level. The described number of species per genus is also given. Notes are provided of taxa for which recent changes or disagreements have been presented. Fungus-like taxa that were traditionally treated as fungi are also incorporated in this outline (i.e. Eumycetozoa, Dictyosteliomycetes, Ceratiomyxomycetes and Myxomycetes). Four new taxa are introduced: Amblyosporida ord. nov. Neopereziida ord. nov. and Ovavesiculida ord. nov. in Rozellomycota, and Protosporangiaceae fam. nov. in Dictyosteliomycetes. Two different classifications (in outline section and in discussion) are provided for Glomeromycota and Leotiomycetes based on recent studies. The phylogenetic reconstruction of a four-gene dataset (18S and 28S rRNA, RPB1, RPB2) of 433 taxa is presented, including all currently described orders of fungi.},

Over 3653 genera (ca. 30,000 morphological species) are known from asexual reproduction (1388 coelomycetes and 2265 hyphomycetes) in their life cycle. Among these, 687 genera are pleomorphic (305 coelomycetous; 378 hyphomycetous and four genera show both coelomycetous and hyphomycetous morphs). We provide notes for these pleomorphic genera in this paper. The 1544 unlinked genera without molecular data (which comprise ca. 3850 species) are listed as Ascomycota genera incertae sedis. It is essential to recollect the fungi which are placed in Ascomycota genera incertae sedis and subject them to DNA based phylogenetic analysis as they might represent new fungal lineages.},

  abstract = {Fungi are one of the most diverse groups of organisms with an estimated number of species in the range of 2--3 million. The higher-level ranking of fungi has been discussed in the framework of molecular phylogenetics since Hibbett et al., and the definition and the higher ranks (e.g., phyla) of the `true fungi' have been revised in several subsequent publications. Rapid accumulation of novel genomic data and the advancements in phylogenetics now facilitate a robust and precise foundation for the higher-level classification within the kingdom. This study provides an updated classification of the kingdom Fungi, drawing upon a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of Holomycota, with which we outline well-supported nodes of the fungal tree and explore more contentious groupings. We accept 19 phyla of Fungi, viz. Aphelidiomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiobolomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Calcarisporiellomycota, Chytridiomycota, Entomophthoromycota, Entorrhizomycota, Glomeromycota, Kickxellomycota, Monoblepharomycota, Mortierellomycota, Mucoromycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Olpidiomycota, Rozellomycota, Sanchytriomycota, and Zoopagomycota. In the phylogenies, Caulochytriomycota resides in Chytridiomycota; thus, the former is regarded as a synonym of the latter, while Caulochytriomycetes is viewed as a class in Chytridiomycota. We provide a description of each phylum followed by its classes. A new subphylum, Sanchytriomycotina Karpov is introduced as the only subphylum in Sanchytriomycota. The subclass Pneumocystomycetidae Kirk et al. in Pneumocystomycetes, Ascomycota is invalid and thus validated. Placements of fossil fungi in phyla and classes are also discussed, providing examples.},

  abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77--i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

  abstract = {Current genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) predict a large number of genomic regions containing potential structural ncRNAs. The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and therefore do not support identification of structural similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of ncRNAs. In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz predictions, LocARNA-P's STAR score allows much stronger discrimination between true- and false-positive predictions than RNAz's own evaluation. The improved accuracy, in this scenario increased from AUC 0.71 to AUC 0.87, significantly reduces the cost of successive analysis steps. The ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces structure-based multiple RNA alignments with associated columnwise STARs and predicts ncRNA boundaries. We provide additional results, a web server for LocARNA/LocARNA-P, and the software package, including documentation and a pipeline for refining screens for structural ncRNA, at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Supplements/LocARNA-P/.},

  abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole-genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited, due to their reliance on sequence-based whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms the widely used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modENCODE RNA-seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating RNA-seq data.},

  abstract = {The idea that many processes in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are dormant until activated by a pulse of rainfall, and then decay from a maximum rate as the soil dries, is widely used as a conceptual and mathematical model, but has rarely been evaluated with data. This paper examines soil water, evapotranspiration (ET), and net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured for 5 years at an eddy covariance tower sited in an Acacia--Combretum savanna near Skukuza in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The analysis characterizes ecosystem flux responses to discrete rain events and evaluates the skill of increasingly complex ``pulse models''. Rainfall pulses exert strong control over ecosystem-scale water and CO2 fluxes at this site, but the simplest pulse models do a poor job of characterizing the dynamics of the response. Successful models need to include the time lag between the wetting event and the process peak, which differ for evaporation, photosynthesis and respiration. Adding further complexity, the time lag depends on the prior duration and degree of water stress. ET response is well characterized by a linear function of potential ET and a logistic function of profile-total soil water content, with remaining seasonal variation correlating with vegetation phenological dynamics (leaf area). A 1- to 3-day lag to maximal ET following wetting is a source of hysteresis in the ET response to soil water. Respiration responds to wetting within days, while photosynthesis takes a week or longer to reach its peak if the rainfall was preceded by a long dry spell. Both processes exhibit nonlinear functional responses that vary seasonally. We conclude that a more mechanistic approach than simple pulse modeling is needed to represent daily ecosystem C processes in semiarid savannas.},

  abstract = {Information about the relative biodiversity value of different waterbody types is a vital pre-requisite for many strategic conservation goals. In practice, however, exceptionally few inter-waterbody comparisons have been made. The current study compared river, stream, ditch and pond biodiversity within an 80 km2 area of lowland British countryside. The results showed that although all waterbody types contributed to the diversity of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in the region, they differed in relative value. Individual river sites were rich but relatively uniform in their species composition. Individual ponds varied considerably in species richness, with the richest sites supporting similar numbers of taxa to the best river sections, but the poorest sites amongst the most impoverished for all waterbody types. At a regional level, however, ponds contributed most to biodiversity, supporting considerably more species, more unique species and more scarce species than other waterbody types. Streams typically supported fewer species and fewer unique species at local and regional level than either ponds or rivers. Ditches (most of which were seasonal) were the least species-rich habitat, but supported uncommon species, including temporary water invertebrates not recorded in other waterbody types. Multivariate analysis indicated that permanence, depth, flow and altitude were the main environmental variables explaining invertebrate and plant assemblage composition. The findings, as a whole, suggest that ponds and other small waterbodies can contribute significantly to regional biodiversity. This contrasts markedly with their relative status in national monitoring and protection strategies, where small waterbodies are largely ignored.},

Divergence dates were estimated in BEAST. Lagrange was used to reconstruct ancestral ranges. BayesTraits was used to reconstruct ectomycorrhizal host associations using extant host associations with data derived from literature sources. {$\bullet$} The supermatrix data set was combined with internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data sets for Astraeus, Calostoma, and Pisolithus to produce a 168 operational taxonomic unit (OTU) supertree. The ensuing analysis estimated that basal Sclerodermatineae originated in the late Cretaceous while major genera diversified near the mid Cenozoic. Asia and North America are the most probable ancestral areas for all Sclerodermatineae, and angiosperms, primarily rosids, are the most probable ancestral hosts. {$\bullet$} Evolution in the Sclerodermatineae follows the biogeographic history of disjunct plant communities associated with early Cenozoic mesophytic forests and a boreotropical history. Broad geographic distributions are observed in the most promiscuous Sclerodermatineae (those with broad host ranges), while those with relatively limited distribution have fewer documented ectomycorrhizal associations. This suggests that ectomycorrhizal generalists have greater dispersal capabilities than specialists.},

  abstract = {Given the diversity and ecological importance of Fungi, there is a lack of population genetic research on these organisms. The reason for this can be explained in part by their cryptic nature and difficulty in identifying genets. In addition the difficulty (relative to plants and animals) in developing molecular markers for fungal population genetics contributes to the lack of research in this area. This study examines the ability of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to generate SNPs in Laccaria bicolor. Eighteen samples of morphologically identified L. bicolor from the United States and Europe were selected for this project. The RAD sequencing method produced anywhere from 290 000 to more than 3 000 000 reads. Mapping these reads to the genome of L. bicolor resulted in 84 000--940 000 unique reads from individual samples. Results indicate that incorporation of non-L. bicolor taxa into the analysis resulted in a precipitous drop in shared loci among samples, suggests the potential of these methods to identify cryptic species. F-statistics were easily calculated, although an observable ``noise'' was detected when using the ``All Loci'' treatment versus filtering loci to those present in at least 50\% of the individuals. The data were analyzed with tests of Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium, population genetic statistics (FIS and FST), and population structure analysis using the program Structure. The results provide encouraging feedback regarding the potential utility of these methods and their data for population genetic analysis. We were unable to draw conclusions of life history of L. bicolor populations from this dataset, given the small sample size. The results of this study indicate the potential of these methods to address population genetics and general life history questions in the Agaricales. Further research is necessary to explore the specific application of these methods in the Agaricales or other fungal groups.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Growth on different carbon, nitrogen and solid substrates was tested. Of ten culture media, malt extract agar was the best for mycelia growth for all isolates. Sucrose was the best carbon source for Termitomyces sp. CMUTM001 and CMUTM002. Fructose was the best carbon source for T. clypeatus CMUTM003 and CMUTM005, while the best growth of isolate CMUTM005 was on glucose. Peptone was the best nitrogen source for enhancing radial growth. In addition, job's tear grain medium gave the highest mycelial growth and may be a suitable substrate for Termitomyces mycelial inocula production.

We used the genus Amanita, an iconic group of mushroom-forming fungi engaged in ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, to identify both the origins and potential genetic changes maintaining the stability of this mutualism. A multi-gene phylogeny reveals one origin of the symbiosis within Amanita, with a single transition from saprotrophic decomposition of dead organic matter to biotrophic dependence on host plants for carbon. Associated with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host plant. Irreversible losses of decomposition pathways are likely to play key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms.},

  abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton--Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  year = {2016},
  pages = {14},
  abstract = {The BUGS language offers a very flexible way of specifying complex statistical models for the purposes of Gibbs sampling, while its JAGS variant offers very convenient R integration via the rjags package. However, including smoothers in JAGS models can involve some quite tedious coding, especially for multivariate or adaptive smoothers. Further, if an additive smooth structure is required then some care is needed, in order to centre smooths appropriately, and to find appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function, jagam, which takes a generalized additive model (GAM) as specified in mgcv and automatically generates the JAGS model code and data required for inference about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can be run as is, the expectation is that the user would wish to modify it in order to add complex stochastic model components readily specified in JAGS. A simple interface is also provided for visualisation and further inference about the estimated smooth components using standard mgcv functionality. The methods described here will be un-necessarily inefficient if all that is required is fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full flexibility of JAGS. In that case the BayesX package would be more efficient.},

Few studies have compared the sensitivity and specificity of these approaches. In the present study environmental DNA from 90 filtered seawater and 120 biofouling samples was analyzed with quantitative PCR (qPCR), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and metabarcoding targeting the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 18S rRNA genes for the Mediterranean fanworm Sabella spallanzanii. The qPCR analyses detected S. spallanzanii in 53\% of water and 85\% of biofouling samples. Using ddPCR S. spallanzanii was detected in 61\% of water of water and 95\% of biofouling samples. There were strong relationships between COI copy numbers determined via qPCR and ddPCR (water R2 = 0.81, p {$<$} .001, biofouling R2 = 0.68, p {$<$} .001); however, qPCR copy numbers were on average 125-fold lower than those measured using ddPCR. Using metabarcoding there was higher detection in water samples when targeting the COI (40\%) compared to 18S rRNA (5.4\%). The difference was less pronounced in biofouling samples (25\% COI, 29\% 18S rRNA). Occupancy modelling showed that although the occupancy estimate was higher for biofouling samples ({$\psi$} = 1.0), higher probabilities of detection were derived for water samples. Detection probabilities of ddPCR (1.0) and qPCR (0.93) were nearly double metabarcoding (0.57 to 0.27 marker dependent). Studies that aim to detect specific invasive or rare species in environmental samples should consider using targeted approaches until a detailed understanding of how community and matrix complexity, and primer biases affect metabarcoding data.},

Multiple sequence alignment programs tend to reach maximal accuracy when aligning only a few sequences, and then diminish steadily as more sequences are added. This drop in accuracy can be partly attributed to a build-up of error and ambiguity as more sequences are aligned. Most high-throughput sequence alignment algorithms do not use contextual information under the assumption that sites are independent. This study examines the extent to which local sequence context can be exploited to improve the quality of large multiple sequence alignments.},

  abstract = {The importance of noncoding RNA sequences has become increasingly clear over the past decade. New RNA families are often detected and analyzed using comparative methods based on multiple sequence alignments. Accordingly, a number of programs have been developed for aligning and deriving secondary structures from sets of RNA sequences. Yet, the best tools for these tasks remain unclear because existing benchmarks contain too few sequences belonging to only a small number of RNA families. RNAconTest (RNA consistency test) is a new benchmarking approach relying on the observation that secondary structure is often conserved across highly divergent RNA sequences from the same family. RNAconTest scores multiple sequence alignments based on the level of consistency among known secondary structures belonging to reference sequences in their output alignment. Similarly, consensus secondary structure predictions are scored according to their agreement with one or more known structures in a family. Comparing the performance of 10 popular alignment programs using RNAconTest revealed that DAFS, DECIPHER, LocARNA, and MAFFT created the most structurally consistent alignments. The best consensus secondary structure predictions were generated by DAFS and LocARNA (via RNAalifold). Many of the methods specific to noncoding RNAs exhibited poor scalability as the number or length of input sequences increased, and several programs displayed substantial declines in score as more sequences were aligned. Overall, RNAconTest provides a means of testing and improving tools for comparative RNA analysis, as well as highlighting the best available approaches. RNAconTest is available from the DECIPHER website (http://DECIPHER.codes/Downloads.html).},

  abstract = {The global bio-diversity of fungi has been extensively investigated and their species number has been estimated. Notably, the development of molecular phylogeny has revealed an unexpected fungal diversity and utilisation of culture-independent approaches including high-throughput amplicon sequencing has dramatically increased number of fungal operational taxonomic units. A number of novel taxa including new divisions, classes, orders and new families have been established in last decade. Many cryptic species were identified by molecular phylogeny. Based on recently generated data from culture-dependent and -independent survey on same samples, the fungal species on the earth were estimated to be 12 (11.7--13.2) million compared to 2.2--3.8 million species recently estimated by a variety of the estimation techniques. Moreover, it has been speculated that the current use of high-throughput sequencing techniques would reveal an even higher diversity than our current estimation. Recently, the formal classification of environmental sequences and permission of DNA sequence data as fungal names' type were proposed but strongly objected by the mycologist community. Surveys on fungi in unusual niches have indicated that many previously regarded ``unculturable fungi'' could be cultured on certain substrates under specific conditions. Moreover, the high-throughput amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics and a single-cell genomics could be a powerful means to detect novel taxa. Here, we propose to separate the fungal types into physical type based on specimen, genome DNA (gDNA) type based on complete genome sequence of culturable and uncluturable fungal specimen and digital type based on environmental DNA sequence data. The physical and gDNA type should have priority, while the digital type can be temporal supplementary before the physical type and gDNA type being available. The fungal name based on the ``digital type'' could be assigned as the ``clade'' name + species name. The ``clade'' name could be the name of genus, family or order, etc. which the sequence of digital type affiliates to. Facilitating future cultivation efforts should be encouraged. Also, with the advancement in knowledge of fungi inhabiting various environments mostly because of rapid development of new detection technologies, more information should be expected for fungal diversity on our planet.},

  abstract = {The global bio-diversity of fungi has been extensively investigated and their species number has been estimated. Notably, the development of molecular phylogeny has revealed an unexpected fungal diversity and utilisation of culture-independent approaches including high-throughput amplicon sequencing has dramatically increased number of fungal operational taxonomic units. A number of novel taxa including new divisions, classes, orders and new families have been established in last decade. Many cryptic species were identified by molecular phylogeny. Based on recently generated data from culture-dependent and -independent survey on same samples, the fungal species on the earth were estimated to be 12 (11.7--13.2) million compared to 2.2--3.8 million species recently estimated by a variety of the estimation techniques. Moreover, it has been speculated that the current use of high-throughput sequencing techniques would reveal an even higher diversity than our current estimation. Recently, the formal classification of environmental sequences and permission of DNA sequence data as fungal names' type were proposed but strongly objected by the mycologist community. Surveys on fungi in unusual niches have indicated that many previously regarded ``unculturable fungi'' could be cultured on certain substrates under specific conditions. Moreover, the high-throughput amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics and a single-cell genomics could be a powerful means to detect novel taxa. Here, we propose to separate the fungal types into physical type based on specimen, genome DNA (gDNA) type based on complete genome sequence of culturable and uncluturable fungal specimen and digital type based on environmental DNA sequence data. The physical and gDNA type should have priority, while the digital type can be temporal supplementary before the physical type and gDNA type being available. The fungal name based on the ``digital type'' could be assigned as the ``clade'' name + species name. The ``clade'' name could be the name of genus, family or order, etc. which the sequence of digital type affiliates to. Facilitating future cultivation efforts should be encouraged. Also, with the advancement in knowledge of fungi inhabiting various environments mostly because of rapid development of new detection technologies, more information should be expected for fungal diversity on our planet.},

  abstract = {Sequence comparison and analysis of the various ribosomal genetic markers are the dominant molecular methods for identification and description of fungi. However, new environmental fungal lineages known only from DNA data reveal significant gaps in our sampling of the fungal kingdom in terms of both taxonomy and marker coverage in the reference sequence databases. To facilitate the integration of reference data from all of the ribosomal markers, we present three sets of general primers that allow for amplification of the complete ribosomal operon from the ribosomal tandem repeats. The primers cover all ribosomal markers: ETS, SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, LSU and IGS. We coupled these primers successfully with third-generation sequencing (PacBio and Nanopore sequencing) to showcase our approach on authentic fungal herbarium specimens (Basidiomycota), aquatic chytrids (Chytridiomycota) and a poorly understood lineage of early diverging fungi (Nephridiophagidae). In particular, we were able to generate high-quality reference data with Nanopore sequencing in a high-throughput manner, showing that the generation of reference data can be achieved on a regular desktop computer without the involvement of any large-scale sequencing facility. The quality of the Nanopore generated sequences was 99.85\%, which is comparable with the 99.78\% accuracy described for Sanger sequencing. With this work, we hope to stimulate the generation of a new comprehensive standard of ribosomal reference data with the ultimate aim to close the huge gaps in our reference datasets.},

The base calling process is very important for TGS. It translates the original electrical signals from the sequencer to the nucleotide sequence. By doing that, the base calling could significantly influence the accuracy of downstream analysis. Bonito is a recently developed basecaller based on deep neuron network, the neuron network architecture of which is composed of a single convolutional layer followed by three stacked bidirectional GRU layers. Although Bonito achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy, its speed is so slow that it is not likely to be used in production. We therefore implement Fast-Bonito, which introduces systematic optimization to speed up Bonito. Fast-Bonito archives 53.8\% faster than the original version on NVIDIA V100 and could be further speed up by HUAWEI Ascend 910 NPU, achieving 565\% faster than the original version. The accuracy of Fast-Bonito is also slightly higher than the original Bonito.},

  abstract = {One interesting question in the study of marine microbial ecology is how ocean currents affect the geographic distributions of microorganisms. The Zhe-Min Coastal Current (ZMCC) is strong in winter and could influence the plankton communities in Hong Kong coastal waters by bringing species from far north. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of microbial eukaryotic communities (MEC) in the ZMCC and evaluated the relative contribution of environmental and spatial factors on the variations of MEC. The results showed that diverse taxa of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) and Dinophyceae (Dinoflagellata) dominated the sequences in all samples. MEC compositions in the Hong Kong coastal waters were closer to the communities in the ZMCC than other adjacent areas. Abundant and rare taxa exhibited a similar geographic pattern of distribution. Environmental factors alone explained 14.1\% and 27.6\% of the variations in the entire and abundant communities, respectively, which were higher than pure spatial factors (8.3\% and 19.5\%, respectively). The lower importance of spatial factors (dispersal limitation) might be explained by the passive dispersal favored by current transportation and was further supported by the high immigration rate computed in the neutral community model (NCM). High fitness to the NCM (R2~=~0.74) indicated the predominant role of neutral process in shaping the MEC. The large proportion of unexplained variations in rare taxa suggested the importance of other potential factors, especially biotic interactions. Our study demonstrates the influences of coastal current on local and regional structures of MEC.},

Properties of the multivariate distributions are investigated, some of which are similar to those of the multivariate normal distribution, which makes these models potentially useful for the analysis of correlated non-normal data in a way analogous to that of multivariate normal data. As an example, we illustrate an application of the models to the regression analysis of longitudinal data, and establish an asymptotic relationship between the likelihood equation and the generalized estimating equation of Liang \& Zeger (1986).},

  abstract = {Technological advances in meta-transcriptomics have enabled a deeper understanding of the structure and function of microbial communities. `Total RNA' meta-transcriptomics, sequencing of total reverse transcribed RNA, provides a unique opportunity to investigate both the structure and function of active microbial communities from all three domains of life simultaneously. A major step of this approach is the reconstruction of full-length taxonomic marker genes such as the small subunit ribosomal RNA. However, current tools for this purpose are mainly targeted towards analysis of amplicon and metagenomic data and thus lack the ability to handle the massive and complex datasets typically resulting from total RNA experiments.In this work, we introduce MetaRib, a new tool for reconstructing ribosomal gene sequences from total RNA meta-transcriptomic data. MetaRib is based on the popular rRNA assembly program EMIRGE, together with several improvements. We address the challenge posed by large complex datasets by integrating sub-assembly, dereplication and mapping in an iterative approach, with additional post-processing steps. We applied the method to both simulated and real-world datasets. Our results show that MetaRib can deal with larger datasets and recover more rRNA genes, which achieve around 60 times speedup and higher F1 score compared to EMIRGE in simulated datasets. In the real-world dataset, it shows similar trends but recovers more contigs compared with a previous analysis based on random sub-sampling, while enabling the comparison of individual contig abundances across samples for the first time.The source code of MetaRib is freely available at https://github.com/yxxue/MetaRib.yaxin.xue@uib.no or Inge.Jonassen@uib.noSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In addition to supporting conventional taxonomic techniques, DNA barcoding is a potent tool that advances our knowledge of species diversity and their ecological functions. On a variety of organisms, the use of this approach for species categorization has been successful. In this paper, we examine how DNA barcoding has been used to classify species based on DNA barcodes as well as other related research that has been done over the years on the subject. After experimenting with a number of deep learning models, we have propose an Ensemble NLP + Multinomial Classifier workflow for classifiying species using DNA barcodes. The models have been assessed on the basis of performance factors including accuracy, recall, and precision. COI, rbcL, matK, and ITS are the specific gene sections that have been identified as barcodes. For both simulated and real datasets, the model can attain an average accuracy of greater than 96 percent. This DNA barcoding approach has the ability to simplify DNA barcode-based species identification and serve as a tool for species categorization.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Large multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), consisting of thousands of sequences, are becoming more and more common, due to advances in sequencing technologies. The MAFFT MSA program has several options for building large MSAs, but their performances have not been sufficiently assessed yet, because realistic benchmarking of large MSAs has been difficult. Recently, such assessments have been made possible through the HomFam and ContTest benchmark protein datasets. Along with the development of these datasets, an interesting theory was proposed: chained guide trees increase the accuracy of MSAs of structurally conserved regions. This theory challenges the basis of progressive alignment methods and needs to be examined by being compared with other known methods including computationally intensive ones.Results: We used HomFam, ContTest and OXFam (an extended version of OXBench) to evaluate several methods enabled in MAFFT: (1) a progressive method with approximate guide trees, (2) a progressive method with chained guide trees, (3) a combination of an iterative refinement method and a progressive method and (4) a less approximate progressive method that uses a rigorous guide tree and consistency score. Other programs, Clustal Omega and UPP, available for large MSAs, were also included into the comparison. The effect of method 2 (chained guide trees) was positive in ContTest but negative in HomFam and OXFam. Methods 3 and 4 increased the benchmark scores more consistently than method 2 for the three datasets, suggesting that they are safer to use.Availability and Implementation:http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/Contact:katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, less is known about the role of soil depth in fungal community assemblages, especially under soil environments that are intensely cold, infertile and water-deficient. In Ngari drylands of the Asiatic Plateau, we studied fungal assemblages at two soil depths, using Illumina sequencing of the ITS2 region for fungal identification (0--15~cm as the surface soil and 15--30~cm as the subsurface soil). Fungal diversity in the surface soil was much higher than that in the subsurface soil (P~{$<~$}0.001), and communities differed significantly between the two layers (P~=~0.001). Neither soil properties nor dispersal limitation could explain variation in the surface-soil fungal community. For the subsurface, by contrast, soil, climate and space explained 27\% of variation in fungal community. Collectively, these results point to high dispersal rates and absence of edaphic effects in the surface-soil fungal community assemblage in Ngari drylands. It also suggests that for soil fungi with highly effective dispersal, regional distributions may fit with Bass-Becking's paradigm that `Everything is everywhere'.},

We investigated the seasonal variations of abundance and diversity of picoeukaryotes, and recorded environmental variables, along a transect in Zhoushan Fishing Ground. High-throughput sequencing was used for sequencing the V4--V5 variable region within the 18S rRNA gene to analyze genetic diversity and relative abundance of picoeukaryotes. A total of 40 phyla, 68 classes, 99 orders, 126 families, and 140 genera were observed. The estimated richness and diversity indices were both higher in each season. The composition and dominant picoeukaryotes changed significantly at the class level with the seasons alternating. Basidiomycota, Ciliophora, Ascomycota and Cryptomonadales were observed throughout the year. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) revealed the predominant discriminant taxa of four seasonal groups. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that NO2- and salinity played very important roles to picoeukaryotes for all the spring samples and DS5 sample in winter, PO43- and pH affected mostly picoeukaryotes for winter samples and autumn samples.},

  abstract = {DNA barcodes with short sequence fragments are used for species identification. Because of advances in sequencing technologies, DNA barcodes have gradually been emphasized. DNA sequences from different organisms are easily and rapidly acquired. Therefore, DNA sequence analysis tools play an increasingly crucial role in species identification. This study proposed deep barcoding, a deep learning framework for species classification by using DNA barcodes. Deep barcoding uses raw sequence data as the input to represent one-hot encoding as a one-dimensional image and uses a deep convolutional neural network with a fully connected deep neural network for sequence analysis. It can achieve an average accuracy of {$>$}90 percent for both simulation and real datasets. Although deep learning yields outstanding performance for species classification with DNA sequences, its application remains a challenge. The deep barcoding model can be a potential tool for species classification and can elucidate DNA barcode-based species identification.},

The performance in the purification of the mine discharge and the concurrent ecosystem development within the system during the period of 1985--2000 has been studied. The untreated wastewater contained rather high concentrations of cadmium (Cd) (0.05 mg L-1), lead (Pb) (11.5 mg L-1), and zinc (Zn) (14.5 mg L-1), which greatly exceed the upper limits for industrial wastewater discharge in China. The constructed wetland system effectively removed Cd by 94.00\%, Pb by 99.04\%, Zn by 97.30\%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 98.95\% from the mine discharge over a long period (over 16 years) leading to significant improvement in water quality; it was also found that there were no significantly annual or monthly variations in pH values, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn concentrations in water collected from the outlet of the wetland. Moreover, diversity and abundance of living organisms, including protozoan, higher plants, terrestrial animals, and birds, increased gradually. The 16-year monitoring results showed a reciprocal relationship, at a certain extent, between restoration of the wetland ecosystem, in other words, the maturity of the wetland, and the long-term efficiency and stability on purifying heavy metal-contaminated wastewater.},

Small differences were found between the metal-contaminated population and the three `clean' populations when seedlings were grown in 1.0 {$\mu$}g ml-1Zn and 10.0 {$\mu$}g ml-1Pb treatment solutions. In general, however, different populations of seedlings showed similar growth responses, metal uptake and indices of Zn, Pb and Cd tolerance when cultured in the same metal-contaminated media for 89 d or in the same metal treatment solutions (ZnSO4:1.0 and 4.0 {$\mu$}g ml-1Zn; Pb(NO3)2: 10.0 and 25.0 {$\mu$}g ml-1Pb; CdSO4: 0.5 and 1.0 {$\mu$}g ml-1Cd) for 3 weeks. There was insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the metal-contaminated population has evolved to a Zn-, Pb- or Cd-tolerant ecotype but the results indicated some differentiation between the populations with that from Hong Kong being the least productive under the experimental conditions used.

One transformative approach, online phylogenetics, aims to incrementally add samples to an ever-growing phylogeny, but there are no previously existing approaches that can efficiently optimize this vast phylogeny under the time constraints of the pandemic.Here, we present matOptimize, a fast and memory-efficient phylogenetic tree optimization tool based on parsimony that can be parallelized across multiple CPU threads and nodes, and provides orders of magnitude improvement in runtime and peak memory usage compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We have developed this method particularly to address the pressing need during the COVID-19 pandemic for daily maintenance and optimization of a comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. matOptimize is currently helping refine on a daily basis possibly the largest-ever phylogenetic tree, containing millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.The matOptimize code is freely available as part of the UShER package (https://github.com/yatisht/usher) and can also be installed via bioconda (https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/usher/README.html).

  abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary inventory of edible macromycetes found in six Sudano-Guinean vegetation types from the protected forest areas of Wari-Maro in Benin (West Africa). Thirty edible species were found in 18 fixed plots (three per vegetation type). Edibility data were obtained from local populations and the literature. Mushroom productions were assessed per species and per plot using the number of produced carpophores and fresh weight (kg/ha). Edible macromycetes from the studied areas are for 86.6\% ectomycorrhizal taxa belonging to Lactarius, Russula and Amanita. The total macromycetous fresh weight production of one season varies from 0.2 to 225.0 kg/ha, depending on the forest type. Open forests, i.e. savanna and woodland savanna, dominated by Caesalpiniaceae yield qualitatively and quantitatively more edible taxa than the denser and rivulet associated or riverain forest types lacking Caesalpinioid trees. Lactarius gymnocarpoides, forming ectomycorrhiza with Isoberlinia doka, is the most common and abundant species in the savannas and woodland savannas. Specific productions of the edible taxa are affected by host tree composition reflected in the forest type. Most species produce quantitatively more fresh weight in the first two months of the rainy season (June-July). Species showing a continuous production throughout the rainy season are rare. The study illustrates that the edible macromycetes from Wari-Maro forest have substantial importance as a renewable non timber forest product (NTFP). The limitations and the main factors, necessary for a succesful valorisation of these NTFP, are discussed. /// Cette {\'e}tude donne l'inventaire des macromyc{\`e}tes comestibles, trouv{\'e}s dans six types de formations foresti{\`e}res de la for{\^e}t class{\'e}e de Wari-Maro (B{\'e}nin, Afrique de l'Ouest) en r{\'e}gion Soudano-guin{\'e}enne.

  abstract = {One of the Grand Challenges in Science is the construction of the Tree of Life, an evolutionary tree containing several million species, spanning all life on earth. However, the construction of the Tree of Life is enormously computationally challenging, as all the current most accurate methods are either heuristics for NP-hard optimization problems or Bayesian MCMC methods that sample from tree space. One of the most promising approaches for improving scalability and accuracy for phylogeny estimation uses divide-and-conquer: a set of species is divided into overlapping subsets, trees are constructed on the subsets, and then merged together using a ``supertree method''. Here, we present Exact-RFS-2, the first polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal supertree of two trees, using the Robinson-Foulds Supertree (RFS) criterion (a major approach in supertree estimation that is related to maximum likelihood supertrees), and we prove that finding the RFS of three input trees is NP-hard. Exact-RFS-2 is available in open source form on Github at https://github.com/yuxilin51/GreedyRFS.},

  abstract = {The mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is commonly used in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding studies, especially for assessing metazoan diversity. Yet, a great number of COI operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or/and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) retrieved from such studies do not get a taxonomic assignment with a reference sequence. To assess and investigate such sequences, we have developed the Dark mAtteR iNvestigator (DARN) software tool. For this purpose, a reference COI-oriented phylogenetic tree was built from 1,593 consensus sequences covering all the three domains of life. With respect to eukaryotes, consensus sequences at the family level were constructed from 183,330 sequences retrieved from the Midori reference 2 database, which represented 70\% of the initial number of reference sequences. Similarly, sequences from 431 bacterial and 15 archaeal taxa at the family level (29\% and 1\% of the initial number of reference sequences respectively) were retrieved from the BOLD and the PFam databases. DARN makes use of this phylogenetic tree to investigate COI pre-processed sequences of amplicon samples to provide both a tabular and a graphical overview of their phylogenetic assignments. To evaluate DARN, both environmental and bulk metabarcoding samples from different aquatic environments using various primer sets were analysed. We demonstrate that a large proportion of non-target prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria and archaea, are also amplified in eDNA samples and we suggest prokaryotic COI sequences to be included in the reference databases used for the taxonomy assignment to allow for further analyses of dark matter. DARN source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hariszaf/darn and as a Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/darn.},

Yet, the construction of these phylogenies is a complex pipeline presenting analytical and computational challenges, especially when the number of sequences is very large. In the past few years, new methods have been developed that aim to enable highly accurate phylogeny estimations on these large datasets, including divide-and-conquer techniques for multiple sequence alignment and/or tree estimation, methods that can estimate species trees from multi-locus datasets while addressing heterogeneity due to biological processes (e.g. incomplete lineage sorting and gene duplication and loss), and methods to add sequences into large gene trees or species trees. Here we present some of these recent advances and discuss opportunities for future improvements.

  abstract = {Edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms (EEMMs) live in the soil in association with the roots of plants, other ectomycorrhizal fungi, and soil organisms, all of which compete for space and nutrients. Consequently, the success of introducing an edible ectomycorrhizal (EEM) fungus into soils with the intention of cultivation is entirely dependent on its ability to survive in this competitive environment. Studies on the composition and structure of ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities in both productive and nonproductive EEMM areas have contributed to a better understanding of the relationship that EEMMs establish with other EM fungi and the environment. These have included morphological studies, the use of molecular tools, and most recently metagenomic methodologies leading to new insights into soil EEMM ecology. In this chapter, we briefly describe the methods that have been used to study EM fungal communities and Web databases that can be used for the identification of ectomycorrhizas such as the recently released eMyCo. We also illustrate the studies that have been conducted on the EM communities in natural and cultivated ecosystems where the most important EEMMs are found.},

  abstract = {Fungi play many essential roles in ecosystems. They facilitate plant access to nutrients and water, serve as decay agents that cycle carbon and nutrients through the soil, water and atmosphere, and are major regulators of macro-organismal populations. Although technological advances are improving the detection and identification of fungi, there still exist key gaps in our ecological knowledge of this kingdom, especially related to function. Trait-based approaches have been instrumental in strengthening our understanding of plant functional ecology and, as such, provide excellent models for deepening our understanding of fungal functional ecology in ways that complement insights gained from traditional and -omics-based techniques. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge of fungal functional ecology, taxonomy and systematics and introduce a novel database of fungal functional traits (FunFun). FunFun is built to interface with other databases to explore and predict how fungal functional diversity varies by taxonomy, guild, and other evolutionary or ecological grouping variables. To highlight how a quantitative trait-based approach can provide new insights, we describe multiple targeted examples and end by suggesting next steps in the rapidly growing field of fungal functional ecology.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution poses a significant threat to the environment, public, and soil health. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are thought to enhance mineral nutrition of their host plants and to confer increased tolerance toward toxic metals. The responses of mycorrhizal fungi to toxic metal cations are diverse and may consist of a reduced uptake of metals by extracellular or intracellular chelation or increased efflux out of the cell or into sequestering compartments.Rhizosphere chemistry is critical to understanding the interactions of mycorrhizae with polluted soils. This, linked to the fact that mycorrhizal diversity is normally high, even on highly contaminated sites, suggests that this diversity may have a significant role in colonization of contaminated sites by ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of ectomycorrhizal fungi to heavy metals in general remain poorly understood, although the recent Tuber melanosporum Vittad. genome sequencing and transcriptome analyses have obtained a global view of metal homeostasis-related genes and pathways in this fungus. The focus of this review is to describe and discuss the tolerance of the ectomycorrhizal fungi, in particular the edible ones, under heavy metal stress conditions.},

The separation of the two traditionally accepted subgenera was not well supported. Each section of Amanita, Vaginatae, Caesareae, Phalloideae, Validae and Amidella was supported as monophyletic by different methods of analysis and data sets of different regions. The monophyly of section Lepidella remained unclear. A few biogeographic and taxonomic implications were inferred: (1) few species of Amanita are widely distributed throughout eastern Asia, Europe and North America. Samples of some previously recognized disjunct species in the Northern Hemisphere were not monophyletic. Thus, the putative intercontinental disjunct distributions of these species were not supported in this study; (2) biogeographic relationships between Amanita of eastern Asia and Europe are relatively close and several taxa are common to both regions, while paired or closely related species between eastern Asia and North America are relatively common, but rarely have been confirmed as disjunct populations of the same species by molecular data yet. A number of species of Amanita in North America labelled with names based on European materials should be regarded as distinct species; (3) a few genetically cryptic species of Amanita in southwestern China need to be delimited; and (4) variations in colour and morphology of the fruit bodies in A. parvipantherina from different localities should be interpreted as modifications of environment.},

  abstract = {This study assessed the fungal community composition and its relationships with properties of surface soils in the Ny-{\AA}lesund Region (Svalbard, High Arctic). A total of thirteen soil samples were collected and soil fungal community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing with fungi-specific primers targeting the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. The following eight soil properties were analyzed: pH, organic carbon (C), organic nitrogen (N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), silicate silicon (SiO42--Si), nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N), phosphate phosphorus (PO43--P), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). A total of 57,952 reads belonging to 541 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found. of these OTUs, 343 belonged to Ascomycota, 100 to Basidiomycota, 31 to Chytridiomycota, 22 to Glomeromycota, 11 to Zygomycota, 10 to Rozellomycota, whereas 24 belonged to unknown fungi. The dominant orders were Helotiales, Verrucariales, Agaricales, Lecanorales, Chaetothyriales, Lecideales, and Capnodiales. The common genera ({$>$}eight soil samples) were Tetracladium, Mortierella, Fusarium, Cortinarius, and Atla. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-rda) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) revealed that soil pH (p = 0.001) was the most significant factor in determining the soil fungal community composition. Members of Verrucariales were found to predominate in soils of pH 8--9, whereas Sordariales predominated in soils of pH 7--8 and Coniochaetales predominated in soils of pH 6--7. The results suggest the presence and distribution of diverse soil fungal communities in the High Arctic, which can provide reliable data for studying the ecological responses of soil fungal communities to climate changes in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic inference is currently done via Markov chain Monte Carlo with simple mechanisms for proposing new states, which hinders exploration efficiency and often requires long runs to deliver accurate posterior estimates. In this paper we present an alternative approach: a variational framework for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We approximate the true posterior using an expressive graphical model for tree distributions, called a subsplit Bayesian network, together with appropriate branch length distributions. We train the variational approximation via stochastic gradient ascent and adopt multi-sample based gradient estimators for different latent variables separately to handle the composite latent space of phylogenetic models. We show that our structured variational approximations are flexible enough to provide comparable posterior estimation to MCMC, while requiring less computation due to a more efficient tree exploration mechanism enabled by variational inference. Moreover, the variational approximations can be readily used for further statistical analysis such as marginal likelihood estimation for model comparison via importance sampling. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.},

  abstract = {Determination and comparisons of complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are important to understand the origin and evolution of mitochondria. Mitogenomes of unicellular protists are particularly informative in this regard because they are gene-rich and display high structural diversity. Ciliates are a highly diverse assemblage of protists and their mitogenomes (linear structure with high A+T content in general) were amongst the first from protists to be characterized and have provided important insights into mitogenome evolution. Here, we report novel mitogenome sequences from three representatives (Strombidium sp., Strombidium cf. sulcatum, and Halteria grandinella) in two dominant ciliate lineages. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses of newly sequenced and previously published ciliate mitogenomes were performed and revealed a number of important insights. We found that the mitogenomes of these three species are linear molecules capped with telomeric repeats that differ greatly among known species. The genomes studied here are highly syntenic, but larger in size and more gene-rich than those of other groups. They also all share an AT-rich tandem repeat region which may serve as the replication origin and modulate initiation of bidirectional transcription. More generally we identified a split version of ccmf, a cytochrome c maturation-related gene that might be a derived character uniting taxa in the subclasses Hypotrichia and Euplotia. Finally, our mitogenome comparisons and phylogenetic analyses support to reclassify Halteria grandinella from the subclass Oligotrichia to the subclass Hypotrichia. These results add to the growing literature on the unique features of ciliate mitogenomes, shedding light on the diversity and evolution of their linear molecular architecture.},

As datasets keep getting larger, it has become difficult to check multiple sequence alignments visually for errors, and thus, automatic error detection methods are needed more than ever before. Alignment masking methods, which are widely used, remove entire aligned sites and may reduce signal as much as or more than they reduce the noise. The alternative we propose here is a surprisingly under-explored approach: looking for errors in small species-specific stretches of the multiple sequence alignments. We introduce a method called TAPER that uses a novel two-dimensional outlier detection algorithm. Importantly, TAPER adjusts its null expectations per site and species, and in doing so, it attempts to distinguish the real heterogeneity (signal) from errors (noise). Our results show that TAPER removes very little data yet finds much of the error. The effectiveness of TAPER depends on several properties of the alignment (e.g. evolutionary divergence levels) and the errors (e.g. their length). By enabling data clean up with minimal loss of signal, TAPER can improve downstream analyses such as phylogenetic reconstruction and selection detection. Data errors, small or large, can reduce confidence in the downstream results, and thus, eliminating them can be beneficial even when downstream analyses are not impacted.},

  abstract = {Motivation: A pan-genome graph represents a collection of genomes and encodes sequence variations between them. It is a powerful data structure for studying multiple similar genomes. Sequence-to-graph alignment is an essential step for the construction and the analysis of pan-genome graphs. However, existing algorithms incur runtime proportional to the product of sequence length and graph size, making them inefficient for aligning long sequences against large graphs. Results: We propose the graph wavefront alignment algorithm (Gwfa), a new method for aligning a sequence to a sequence graph. Although the worst-case time complexity of Gwfa is the same as the existing algorithms, it is designed to run faster for closely matching sequences, and its runtime in practice often increases only moderately with the edit distance of the optimal alignment. On four real datasets, Gwfa is up to four orders of magnitude faster than other exact sequence-to-graph alignment algorithms. We also propose a graph pruning heuristic on top of Gwfa, which can achieve an additional \${\textbackslash}sim\$10-fold speedup on large graphs. Availability: Gwfa code is accessible at https://github.com/lh3/gwfa.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to determine if soil ergosterol concentration provides a quantitative estimate of the soil fungal biomass concentration, as is usually assumed. This was done by comparing soil ergosterol measurements with soil fungal biomass (fungal biomass C) concentrations estimated by microscopic measurements and by the selective inhibition technique linked to substrate-induced respiration (SIR). The measurements were compared in a silty--clay loam soil given a range of previous treatments designed to increase or decrease the soil fungal biomass and so also to change the soil ergosterol concentration. The treatments used were ryegrass amendment, to increase the total and fungal biomass, and CHCl3-fumigation and the addition of the biocides, captan, bronopol and dinoseb, to decrease both ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations. The mineralization of ergosterol following addition to sand innoculated with soil extract, and to a sandy loam soil, was also determined. The added ergosterol was little, if at all, degraded following addition to either sand or the unfumigated or fumigated soil during a 10d aerobic incubation. Similarly, pesticide addition did not significantly change soil ergosterol concentrations yet the soil fungal biomass C concentration decreased significantly. Thus, the ratio: (soil ergosterol concentration/soil fungal biomass C concentration) was much higher in the pesticide-treated soils than the control soil. Following ryegrass amendment, soil ergosterol concentration increased from about 6--12{$\mu$}g-1 soil within 5d and then decreased gradually to about 7{$\mu$}gg-1 soil by 20d incubation. Changes in fungal biomass C (measured by direct microscopy) closely mirrored changes in soil ergosterol over this period. However, when the amended soil was fumigated and then incubated for a further 5d, the initial ergosterol concentration declined from 7 to 5{$\mu$}gg-1 soil by 20d incubation (a decline of about 0.4). The comparable decline in fungal biomass C was about eight-fold. Thus the ratio of ergosterol to fungal biomass C increased from 0.005 to about 0.01. There was a significant correlation (r{$>$}0.84, P{$<$}0.001) between soil ergosterol concentration and fungal biomass measured by either SIR or microscopy. However, three data points played a vital role in the correlation. When these points were excluded the relationship was very poor (r{$<$}0.4). Our results therefore suggest that substantial amounts of ergosterol may exist, other than in living cells, for considerable periods, with little, if any mineralization. Thus, these results indicate that ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations are not always closely correlated, due to the slow metabolism of ergosterol in recently dead fugal biomass and/or the existence of exocellular ergosterol in soil.},

  abstract = {The current consensus for the eukaryote tree of life consists of several large assemblages (supergroups) that are hypothesized to describe the existing diversity. Phylogenomic analyses have shed light on the evolutionary relationships within and between supergroups as well as placed newly sequenced enigmatic species close to known lineages. Yet, a few eukaryote species remain of unknown origin and could represent key evolutionary forms for inferring ancient genomic and cellular characteristics of eukaryotes. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origin of the poorly studied protist Collodictyon (subphylum Diphyllatia) by sequencing a cDNA library as well as the 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes. Phylogenomic trees inferred from 124 genes placed Collodictyon close to the bifurcation of the ``unikont'' and ``bikont'' groups, either alone or as sister to the potentially contentious excavate Malawimonas. Phylogenies based on rDNA genes confirmed that Collodictyon is closely related to another genus, Diphylleia, and revealed a very low diversity in environmental DNA samples. The early and distinct origin of Collodictyon suggests that it constitutes a new lineage in the global eukaryote phylogeny. Collodictyon shares cellular characteristics with Excavata and Amoebozoa, such as ventral feeding groove supported by microtubular structures and the ability to form thin and broad pseudopods. These may therefore be ancient morphological features among eukaryotes. Overall, this shows that Collodictyon is a key lineage to understand early eukaryote evolution.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the ability to distinguish self from nonself (allorecognition) and mechanisms underlying evolution of allorecognition systems is an important endeavor for understanding cases where it becomes dysfunctional, such as in autoimmune disorders. In filamentous fungi, allorecognition can result in vegetative or heterokaryon incompatibility, which is a type of programmed cell death that occurs following fusion of genetically different cells. Allorecognition is genetically controlled by het loci, with coexpression of any combination of incompatible alleles triggering vegetative incompatibility. Herein, we identified, characterized, and inferred the evolutionary history of candidate het loci in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. As characterized het loci encode proteins carrying an HET domain, we annotated HET domain genes in 25 isolates from a natural population along with the N. crassa reference genome using resequencing data. Because allorecognition systems can be affected by frequency-dependent selection favoring rare alleles (i.e., balancing selection), we mined resequencing data for HET domain loci whose alleles displayed elevated levels of variability, excess of intermediate frequency alleles, and deep gene genealogies. From these analyses, 34 HET domain loci were identified as likely to be under balancing selection. Using transformation, incompatibility assays and genetic analyses, we determined that one of these candidates functioned as a het locus (het-e). The het-e locus has three divergent allelic groups that showed signatures of positive selection, intra- and intergroup recombination, and trans-species polymorphism. Our findings represent a compelling case of balancing selection functioning on multiple alleles across multiple loci potentially involved in allorecognition.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a phylogenetic overview of Basidiomycota and related phyla in relation to ten years of DNA based phylogenetic studies since the AFTOL publications in 2007. We selected 529 species to address phylogenetic relationships of higher-level taxa using a maximum-likelihood framework and sequence data from six genes traditionally used in fungal molecular systematics (nrLSU, nrSSU, 5.8S, tef1-{$\alpha$}, rpb1 and rpb2). These species represent 18 classes, 62 orders, 183 families, and 392 genera from the phyla Basidiomycota (including the newly recognized subphylum Wallemiomycotina) and Entorrhizomycota, and 13 species representing 13 classes of Ascomycota as outgroup taxa. We also conducted a molecular dating analysis based on these six genes for 116 species representing 17 classes and 54 orders of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota. Finally we performed a phyloproteomics analysis from 109 Basidiomycota species and 6 outgroup taxa using amino-acid sequences retrieved from 396 orthologous genes. Recognition of higher taxa follows the criteria in Zhao et al (Fungal Divers 78:239--292, 2016): (i) taxa must be monophyletic and statistically well-supported in molecular dating analyses, (ii) their respective stem ages should be roughly equivalent, and (iii) stem ages of higher taxa must be older than those of lower level taxa. The time-tree indicates that the mean of stem ages of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota are ca. 530 Ma; subphyla of Basidiomycota are 406--490 Ma; most classes are 358--393 Ma for those of Agaricomycotina and 245--356 Ma for those of Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina; most orders of those subphyla split 120--290 Ma. Monophyly of most higher-level taxa of Basidiomycota are generally supported, especially those taxa introduced in the recent ten years: phylum Entorrhizomycota, classes Malasseziomycetes, Moniliellomycetes, Spiculogloeomycetes, Tritirachiomycetes and orders Amylocorticiales, Golubeviales, Holtermanniales, Jaapiales, Lepidostromatales, Robbauerales, Stereopsidales and Trichosporonales. However, the younger divergence times of Leucosporidiales (Microbotryomycetes) indicate that its order status is not supported, thus we propose combining it under Microbotryales. On the other hand, the families Buckleyzymaceae and Sakaguchiaceae (Cystobasidiomycetes) are raised to Buckleyzymales and Sakaguchiales due to their older divergence times. Cystofilobasidiales (Tremellomycetes) has an older divergence time and should be amended to a higher rank. We however, do not introduce it as new class here for Cystofilobasidiales, as DNA sequences from these taxa are not from their respective types and thus await further studies. Divergence times for Exobasidiomycetes, Cantharellales, Gomphales and Hysterangiales were obtained based on limited species sequences in molecular dating study. More comprehensive phylogenetic studies on those four taxa are needed in the future because our ML analysis based on wider sampling, shows they are not monophyletic groups. In general, the six-gene phylogenies are in agreement with the phyloproteomics tree except for the placements of Wallemiomycotina, orders Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales, Cantharellales, Geastrales, Sebacinales and Trechisporales from Agaricomycetes. These conflicting placements in the six-gene phylogeny vs the phyloproteomics tree are discussed. This leads to future perspectives for assessing gene orthology and problems in deciphering taxon ranks using divergence times.},

Inosine residues are sometimes used in the primers to match variable positions within the complementary target sequences, but there is little data on their effects on cDNA synthesis and amplification. A quantitative reverse-transcription PCR was used to measure the rate of amplification with primers containing inosine residues substituted at different positions and in increasing numbers. Experiments were conducted using standard quantities of cloned DNA copied from Potato virus Y genomic RNA and RNA (cRNA) transcribed from the cloned DNA. Single inosine residues had no affect on the amplification rate in the forward primer, except at one position close to the 3{$\prime$} terminus. Conversely, single inosine residues significantly reduced the amplification rate when placed at three out of four positions in the reverse primer. Four or five inosine substitutions could be tolerated with some decline in rates, but amplification often failed from cRNA templates with primers containing larger numbers of inosines. Greater declines in the rate of amplification were observed with RNA templates, suggesting that reverse transcription suffers more than PCR amplification when inosine is included in the reverse primer.},

However, existing methods scale poorly with respect to the unprecedented growth of input data size. As high-performance computing systems are becoming widely accessible, it is highly desired that a clustering method can easily scale to handle large-scale sequence datasets by leveraging the power of parallel computing.In this paper, we introduce SLAD (Separation via Landmark-based Active Divisive clustering), a generic computational framework that can be used to parallelize various de novo operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking methods and comes with theoretical guarantees on both accuracy and efficiency. The proposed framework was implemented on Apache Spark, which allows for easy and efficient utilization of parallel computing resources. Experiments performed on various datasets demonstrated that SLAD can significantly speed up a number of popular de novo OTU picking methods and meanwhile maintains the same level of accuracy. In particular, the experiment on the Earth Microbiome Project dataset ({$\sim$}2.2B reads, 437 GB) demonstrated the excellent scalability of the proposed method.Open-source software for the proposed method is freely available at https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/{\textasciitilde}yijunsun/lab/SLAD.html.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We discuss their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages within the context of environmental applications and focus on analysis of complex microbial systems, such as those in soils, in which diversity is high and reference genomes are few. In addition, we discuss crucial issues and considerations associated with applying complementary high-throughput molecular technologies to address important ecological questions.},

Approximately 5\% of a practical estimate of 2.2--3.8 million species globally are currently known, and consequently the Fungal Tree of Life (FTOL) is very incompletely reconstructed. With the advances of new technologies, mycology is marching into the interdisciplinary and globalisation era. To make fungal taxonomy relevant, innovative sampling methods and phylogenomics analyses should be performed to reconstruct a much more comprehensive FTOL. In association with this densely sampled FTOL, multiomics will reveal what drives fungal species diversification and how fungal traits evolve to adapt to various environments, while metagenomics will facilitate the understanding and protection of the ecological functions of fungi. A coordinated approach to pursuing these research agendas that includes conceiving of and costing a mission to describe all the fungi on the planet will unlock potential of fungi to support sustainable development of our society.},

The incidence of infection and mechanism of transmission of these organisms in humans is unknown. Several recent tests for human pathogens have been developed using rRNA genes as diagnostic probes. Using the polymerase chain reaction and conserved regions of the small subunit rRNA (SSUrRNA) gene, the SSU-rRNA gene of E. bieneusi was successfully cloned and subsequently sequenced. Amplification of E. bieneusi rRNA could be demonstrated from intestinal biopsies from HIV-1-infected patients infected with E. bieneusi but not from intestinal biopsies from noninfected patients. This cloned SSU-rRNA gene was used to develop improved probes for detection of E. bieneusi in tissue of infected patients.},

Following reverse transcription, three cycles of PCR are performed using a modified oligo(dT) primer and an anchor primer to enrich the cDNA population for fulllength sequences. Starting with 1 {$\mu$}g human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA, a cDNA library was constructed that contained 3 {\texttimes} 106 independent clones with an average insert size of 2 kb. Sequence analysis of 172 randomly selected clones showed that 77\% of cDNA clones corresponding to known genes contained intact open reading frames. The average length of complete open reading frames was 2.4 kb. Furthermore, 86\% of the full-length clones retained longer 5{$\prime$} UTR sequences than the longest 5{$\prime$} end deposited in the GenBank{\textregistered} database. cDNA libraries generated using this method will be useful for accelerating the collection of mRNA 5{$\prime$} end sequence information, which is currently very limited in GenBank.},

The phylogenetic analyses based on five gene markers (ITS, nrLSU, tef1-{$\alpha$}, rpb1 and rpb2) recognized five distinct taxa. Four of them are treated here, with one undescribed due to lack of adequate material. A key to the four species of Hourangia is provided. Xerocomus punctilifer is treated as a synonym of H. cheoi according to the macro-morphological and micro-morphological comparative study.

The appropriate markers should be single-copy, variable, easy to amplify from multiple samples and easy to sequence using high-throughput technologies. This may be difficult to achieve for species lacking sequenced genomes and particularly challenging for species possessing large genomes, which consist mostly of repetitive sequences. Here, we present a cost-effective, broadly applicable framework for designing, validating and high-throughput sequencing of multiple markers in nonmodel species without sequenced genomes. We demonstrate its utility in two closely related species of newts, representatives of urodeles, a vertebrate group characterized by large genomes. We show that over 80 markers, c. 600 bp each, developed mainly from 3{$\prime$} untranslated transcript regions (3{$\prime$}UTR) may be effectively multiplexed and sequenced. Data are further processed using standard, freely available bioinformatic tools, producing phase-resolved sequences. The approach does not require barcoded PCR primers, and the cost of library preparation is independent of the number of markers investigated. We hope that this approach will be of broad interest for researchers working at the interface of population genetics and phylogenetics, exploring deep intraspecific genetic structure, species boundaries and phylogeographies of closely related species.},

However, there is often confusion between determining the phylogenetic structure of microbial communities and assessing the distribution and diversity of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in these communities. This has led to the use of sequence analysis tools such as multiple alignments and hierarchical clustering that are not adapted to the analysis of large and diverse data sets and not always justified for characterization of MOTUs. Here, we developed an approach combining a pairwise alignment algorithm and graph partitioning by using MCL (Markov clustering) in order to generate discrete groups for nuclear large-subunit rRNA gene and internal transcript spacer 1 sequence data sets obtained from a yearly monitoring study of two spatially close but ecologically contrasting alpine soils (namely, early and late snowmelt locations). We compared MCL with a classical single-linkage method (Ccomps) and showed that MCL reduced bias such as the chaining effect. Using MCL, we characterized fungal communities in early and late snowmelt locations. We found contrasting distributions of MOTUs in the two soils, suggesting that there is a high level of habitat filtering in the assembly of alpine soil fungal communities. However, few MOTUs were specific to one location.},

We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric method for species sampling modelling by directly specifying the probability of a new discovery, therefore allowing for flexible specifications. The asymptotic behavior and finite sample properties of such an approach are extensively studied. Interestingly, our enlarged class of sequential processes includes highly tractable special cases. We present a subclass of models characterized by appealing theoretical and computational properties. Moreover, due to strong connections with logistic regression models, the latter subclass can naturally account for covariates. We finally test our proposal on both synthetic and real data, with special emphasis on a large fungal biodiversity study in Finland.},

  abstract = {In ecology it has become common to apply DNA barcoding to biological samples leading to datasets containing a large number of nucleotide sequences. The focus is then on inferring the taxonomic placement of each of these sequences by leveraging on existing databases containing reference sequences having known taxa. This is highly challenging because i) sequencing is typically only available for a relatively small region of the genome due to cost considerations; ii) many of the sequences are from organisms that are either unknown to science or for which there are no reference sequences available. These issues can lead to substantial classification uncertainty, particularly in inferring new taxa. To address these challenges, we propose a new class of Bayesian nonparametric taxonomic classifiers, BayesANT, which use species sampling model priors to allow new taxa to be discovered at each taxonomic rank. Using a simple product multinomial likelihood with conjugate Dirichlet priors at the lowest rank, a highly efficient algorithm is developed to provide a probabilistic prediction of the taxa placement of each sequence at each rank. BayesANT is shown to have excellent performance in real data, including when many sequences in the test set belong to taxa unobserved in training.},

This task is performed by leveraging existing databases containing reference DNA sequences endowed with a taxonomic identification. However, environmental sequences can be from organisms that are either unknown to science or for which there are no reference sequences available. Thus, taxonomic novelty of a sequence needs to be accounted for when doing classification. We propose Bayesian nonparametric taxonomic classifiers, BayesANT, which use species sampling model priors to allow unobserved taxa to be discovered at each taxonomic rank. Using a simple product multinomial likelihood with conjugate Dirichlet priors at the lowest rank, a highly flexible supervised algorithm is developed to provide a probabilistic prediction of the taxa placement of each sequence at each rank. As an illustration, we run our algorithm on a carefully annotated library of Finnish arthropods (FinBOL). To assess the ability of BayesANT to recognize novelty and to predict known taxonomic affiliations correctly, we test it on two training-test splitting scenarios, each with a different proportion of taxa unobserved in training. We show how our algorithm attains accurate predictions and reliably quantifies classification uncertainty, especially when many sequences in the test set are affiliated to taxa unknown in training. By enabling taxonomic predictions for DNA barcodes to identify unseen branches, we believe BayesANT will be of broad utility as a tool for DNA metabarcoding within bioinformatics pipelines.},

  abstract = {Sequence clustering is a basic bioinformatics task that is attracting renewed attention with the development of metagenomics and microbiomics. The latest sequencing techniques have decreased costs and as a result, massive amounts of DNA/RNA sequences are being produced. The challenge is to cluster the sequence data using stable, quick and accurate methods. For microbiome sequencing data, 16S ribosomal RNA operational taxonomic units are typically used. However, there is often a gap between algorithm developers and bioinformatics users. Different software tools can produce diverse results and users can find them difficult to analyze. Understanding the different clustering mechanisms is crucial to understanding the results that they produce. In this review, we selected several popular clustering tools, briefly explained the key computing principles, analyzed their characters and compared them using two independent benchmark datasets. Our aim is to assist bioinformatics users in employing suitable clustering tools effectively to analyze big sequencing data. Related data, codes and software tools were accessible at the link http://lab.malab.cn/{$\sim$}lg/clustering/.},

  abstract = {Being informational, enzymatic, as well as a nanoscale molecular machine, ribonucleic acid (RNA) permeates all areas of biology and has been exploited in biotechnology as drug and sensor. Here we describe the composition and fundamental properties of RNA and how the single-stranded RNA chains fold and shape certain motifs that are repeatedly observed in different structures. Small and large molecular mass RNA binders are being touched upon, as is the technology for selecting RNA molecules in vitro that bind almost any kind of natural or artificial target. Recognizing the versatility of RNA is expected to foster the development of tools which monitor RNA in the environment, including plants, animals, and patients. Many of the noncoding RNAs are yet to be identified in the rapidly emerging genomes and assigned to functions. It is hoped that these and similar worthwhile goals will be achieved by integrating the efforts of bench and computer scientists.},
