\arguments{
\item{seq}{(\code{character} vector) DNA sequences to calculate distances for}

\item{dist_threshold}{(\code{numeric} scalar) maximum sequence distance (edit
distance / alignment length) threshold for reporting}

\item{constrain}{(\code{logical} flag) if \code{TRUE}, the alignment algorithm will
use optimizations that will cause it to exit early if the optimal alignment
has a distance greater than the distance threshold. This should not change
the correctness of distance calculations below the threshold, and results in
a large speedup. It is recommended to use \code{constrain=FALSE} only to verify
that the results do not change.}

\item{threads}{(\code{integer} count) number of parallel threads to use for
computation.}

\item{udist_threshold}{(\code{numeric} scalar between 0 and 1) maximum udist
(number of shared kmers / number of kmers in the shorter sequence) for full
alignment.}

\item{prealign}{(\code{logical} flag) if \code{TRUE}, do a prealignment using
edit-distance as alignment score (\verb{match = 0, mismatch = 1, gap_open = 0, gap_extend = 1, gap_open2 = 0, gap_extend2 = 1}) to test feasibility before
aligning with alternate alignment scores. Note that, since pairwise distance
is defined using edit distance, any other set of scores will always result
in a pairwise distance which is equal to or greater than an alignment based
on the edit distance score.}
}
\value{
(\code{data.frame}) a sparse distance matrix; columns are \code{seq1} and
\code{seq2} for the 0-based indices of two sequences; \code{score1} and \code{score2} are
the optimal alignment score for the two sequences in the "prealignment" (if
any) and "alignment" stages; \code{dist1} and \code{dist2} are the corresponding
sequence distances.
