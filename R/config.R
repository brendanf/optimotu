#' Configuration for clustering algorithms
#'
#' @details
#' # Tree method
#'
#' The tree method maintains the state of the clustering algorithm using a
#' tree structure. When there are more than a few thresholds, it uses less
#' memory than the matrix methods, and requires fewer operations to update.
#' However, because its data structure is less cache friendly and it requires
#' multiple memory accesses to determine whether an incoming pairwise distance
#' will lead to a cluster update, it is often slower than the matrix-based
#' methods for small datasets.
#'
#' # Matrix method
#'
#' The matrix method maintains the state of the clustering algorithm in a
#' contiguous matrix structure; for matrix output and when using a single thread
#' or concurrent parallelism, this does not require any additional memory beyond
#' what is required to store the output. The matrix method uses the least code,
#' and despite the higher number of operations required for updates, it is
#' competitive due to its \eqn{\mathcal{O}(1)}{O(1)} checks on incoming pairwise
#' distances and good cache locality.
#'
#' # Index(ed matrix) method
#'
#' The indexed matrix method uses a linked-list index which maintains a
#' permutation of the columns of the cluster matrix such that all clusters are
#' contiguous.  This adds some overhead to updates in order to maintain the
#' index, but significantly reduces the number of matrix columns which must be
#' accessed during each update.
#'
#' # SLINK method
#'
#' Published by Sibson (1972), the SLINK method is optimally fast and low-memory.
#' Its only downside is that it can only accept the distances in canonical order;
#' it is not applicable to methods which may return distances in random order,
#' such as kmer indexing (e.g., usearch/vsearch) or methods where multiple
#' asynchronous workers are feeding a single instance of SLINK.

#' Configuration for parallelization options
#'
#' @details
#'
#' # Merge method
#'
#' In the merge method, each thread works on an independent clustering of the
#' data, based on its own (disjoint) subset of the distance matrix. When each
#' thread finishes clustering, it merges its results into the master clustering.
#' This avoids concurrency collisions between the threads during the main
#' clustering, although collisions can still occur if multiple threads try to
#' merge at the same time.
#'
#' # Concurrent method
#'
#' In the concurrent method, all threads work jointly on the same clustering of
#' the data. Although many threads can simultaneously read the clustering to
#' determine whether a new pairwise distance will lead to an update (most do
#' not), only one thread can update the clustering at a time, so this method
#' can lead to more concurrency collisions when many threads are in use.
#' However, sharing the state of the clustering between threads leads to fewer
#' total updates than the merge method.
#'
#' # Hierarchical method
#'
#' The hierarchical method is a combination of several "shards", each of which
#' in turn has multiple threads. Each shard has one clustering object, which the
#' threads within the shard update concurrently. When all threads in the shard
#' have finished, then the results from the shard are merged into the master
#' clustering. This is probably the most efficient method when there are very
#' many threads, but the optimal number of shards varies between data sets.
